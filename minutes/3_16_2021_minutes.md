### Big Question Revised
**Throughout the Norse Tales how do characters' actions/traits influence the reader's perception of them in their stories?**

*After diuscussion, our group decided that the framing of our big question decided upon before, is broad enough to encompass
all of our subquestions, while remaining direct enough to convey the topic of our research.*

### Sub Questions Outline
(Animal traits/actions)

(Do human traits/actions differ from others' traits/actions?)

(Transformations) - look at actions and descriptors before and after transforming and compare

*How transformation influences a character over a period of time? How is their perception is altered?*

(Compare character's positive/negative with their actions/traits being positive/negative)

*How is each character described in terms of posititivy or negativity?*

(character interactions and positive/negative relations) - Network graph visual. Seperate network graphs into perception and actions to compare differences

*How to character perceptions of other characters differ from character actions on other characters in terms of positivity and negativity?*

*How are character interactions with each other, in terms of positivity and negativity, represented?*

### Sub Questions Finalized

*How do different species' actions/traits differ from other species?*

*How does transformation influence a character throughout their tale? How is their perception is altered post transformation?*

*Does the positivity/negativity of a character's actions/traits corralate directly to the character's overall positivity/negativity?*

*How do perceptions of other characters differ from actions on other characters in terms of positivity and negativity?*

*How are character interactions with each other, in terms of positivity and negativity, represented? Does character species play a role in the interaction?*
