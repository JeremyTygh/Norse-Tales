## Updates

Tales have been read and some have been preliminarily marked-up. Our goal now is the generate our schema so that we can consolidate our markupnunder the same guise.

### Schema Notes

`<story>` element as root

`<title>,<body>` tags inside of `<story>`

`<p>` elements breaking up paragraphs inside of `<body>`

`<character>,<action>,<descriptor>,<transformation>,<fig_lang>,<dialogue>,<misconception>` elements inside of paragraphs.

### Research Question Discussion

Reality vs Perception/Imagination. i.e. how characters are viewed by others vs how they're represented in the text.

### Work for Next Time

Markup documents using new schema as the guideline. Get 1-2 stories markedup and brainstorm ideas for HTML page.
