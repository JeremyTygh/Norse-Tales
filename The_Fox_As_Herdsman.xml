    <title>THE FOX AS HERDSMAN</title>

    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was a woman who went out to hire a herdsman, and she met a bear.</p>

        <p><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear">“Whither away, Goody?” said <character
                    type="bear">Bruin</character></fig_lang>.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Oh, I’m going out to hire a herdsman”,
                answered the woman.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear">
                <dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman">“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said
                    Bruin.</dialogue>
            </fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Well, why not?” said the woman. “If you only
                knew how to call the flock; just let me hear?”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman">“OW, OW!” growled the bear.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“No, no! I won’t have you”, said the woman, as
                soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So, when she had gone a bit further, she met a wolf.</p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf">
                <dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman">“Whither away, Goody?” asked the <character
                        type="wolf">Wolf</character>.</dialogue>
            </fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Oh!” said she, “I’m going out to hire a
                herdsman.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman">“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said the
                Wolf.</dialogue></fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Well, why not? if you can only call the flock;
                let me hear?” said she.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman">“UH, UH!” said the Wolf.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“No, no!” said the woman; “you’ll never do for
                me.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a fox.</p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“Whither away, Goody?” asked the
                Fox.</dialogue></fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Oh, I’m just going out to hire a herdsman”, said the woman.</dialogue></p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“Why not have me for your herdsman?”
                asked the Fox.</dialogue></fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Well, why not?” said she; “if you only knew how to call the flock; let me hear?”</dialogue></p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“DIL-DAL-HOLOM”, sung out the Fox, in such a fine clear voice.</dialogue></p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Yes; I’ll have you for my herdsman”, said the woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her
            flock.</dialogue></p>

        <p>The first day the Fox was herdsman he <action actor="fox" subject="woman"><textual_content character="fox is duplicitous">ate up all the
                woman’s goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the third day he
                ate up all her kine.</textual_content></action> So, when he came home at even, the woman asked what he
            had done with all her flocks?</p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="pesonification" subject="fox"><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“Oh!” said the Fox, “their skulls are in
                the stream, and their bodies in the holt.”</dialogue></fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p>Now, the Goody stood and churned when the fox said this, but she thought she might as
            well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away <action actor="fox"
                subject="cream">the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the cream.</action> So when
            the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage, that <descriptor
                speaker="storyteller" subject="fox"><action actor="woman" subject="fox">she snatched
                    up the little morsel of the cream that was left, and threw it at the fox as he
                    ran off,</action> so that he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that’s
                the reason why the fox has a white tip to his brush.</descriptor></p>
