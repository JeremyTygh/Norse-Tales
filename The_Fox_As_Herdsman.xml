    <title>THE FOX AS HERDSMAN</title>
    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was a <character who="woman">woman</character> who went out to hire
            a herdsman, and she met a <character who="bear">bear</character>.</p>
        <p><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear">“Whither away, Goody?” said <character
                    who="bear">Bruin</character></fig_lang>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Oh, I’m going out to hire a herdsman”,
                answered the <character who="woman">woman</character>.</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear"
                    >“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said <character who="bear"
                    >Bruin</character>.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Well, why not?” said the <character
                    who="woman">woman</character>. “If you only knew how to call the flock; just let
                me hear?”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman">“OW, OW!” growled the <character who="bear">bear</character>.</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“No, no! I won’t have you”, said the <character who="woman">woman</character>,</dialogue> as
                soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.
        </p>
        <p>So, when she had gone a bit further, she met a <character who="wolf">wolf</character>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"
                    >“Whither away, Goody?” asked the <character who="wolf">Wolf</character>.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Oh!” said she, “I’m going out to hire a
                herdsman.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"
                    >“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said the Wolf.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Well, why not? if you can only call the flock;
                let me hear?” said she.</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman">“UH, UH!” said the <character who="wolf">Wolf</character>.</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“No, no!” said the <character who="woman">woman</character>; “you’ll never do for
                me.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a <character who="fox">fox</character>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"
                    >“Whither away, Goody?” asked the <character who="fox">Fox</character>.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Oh, I’m just going out to hire a herdsman”, said
                the <character who="woman">woman</character>.</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"
                    >“Why not have me for your herdsman?” asked the <character who="fox">Fox</character>.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Well, why not?” said she; “if you only knew how
                to call the flock; let me hear?”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“DIL-DAL-HOLOM”, sung out the <character who="fox">Fox</character>, in such a fine
                clear voice.</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Yes; I’ll have you for my herdsman”, said the
                woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.</dialogue></p>
        <p>The first day the <character who="fox">Fox</character> was herdsman he <action actor="fox" subject="woman" sign="negative"
                >ate up all the woman’s goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the
                third day he ate up all her kine.</action> So, when he came home at even, the woman
            asked what he had done with all her flocks?</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="pesonification" subject="fox"
                    >“Oh!” said the <character who="fox">Fox</character>, “their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the
                    holt.”</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p>Now, <character who="woman">the Goody</character> stood and churned when the fox said this, but she thought she might as
            well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away <action actor="fox"
                subject="cream" sign="negative">the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the
                cream.</action> So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage,
            that <descriptor speaker="narrator" subject="fox" sign="negative"><action
                    actor="woman" subject="fox" sign="negative">she snatched up the little morsel of
                    the cream that was left, and threw it at the fox as he ran off,</action> so that
                he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that’s the reason why the fox has a
                white tip to his brush.</descriptor></p>
