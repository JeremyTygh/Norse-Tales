    <title>THE FOX AS HERDSMAN</title>

    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was a <character>woman</character> who went out to hire a herdsman,
            and she met a <character>bear</character>.</p>

        <p><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear">“Whither away, Goody?” said
                Bruin</fig_lang>.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Oh, I’m going out to hire a herdsman”,
                answered the woman.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear"
                    >“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said Bruin.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Well, why not?” said the woman. “If you only
                knew how to call the flock; just let me hear?”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman">“OW, OW!” growled the bear.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“No, no! I won’t have you”, said the woman, as
                soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So, when she had gone a bit further, she met a <character>wolf</character>.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"
                    >“Whither away, Goody?” asked the Wolf.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Oh!” said she, “I’m going out to hire a
                herdsman.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"
                    >“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said the Wolf.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Well, why not? if you can only call the flock;
                let me hear?” said she.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman">“UH, UH!” said the Wolf.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“No, no!” said the woman; “you’ll never do for
                me.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a <character>fox</character>.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"
                    >“Whither away, Goody?” asked the Fox.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Oh, I’m just going out to hire a herdsman”, said
                the woman.</dialogue></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"
                    >“Why not have me for your herdsman?” asked the Fox.</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Well, why not?” said she; “if you only knew how
                to call the flock; let me hear?”</dialogue></p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“DIL-DAL-HOLOM”, sung out the Fox, in such a fine
                clear voice.</dialogue></p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Yes; I’ll have you for my herdsman”, said the
                woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.</dialogue></p>

        <p>The first day the Fox was herdsman he <action actor="fox" subject="woman" sign="negative"
                >ate up all the woman’s goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the
                third day he ate up all her kine.</action> So, when he came home at even, the woman
            asked what he had done with all her flocks?</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="pesonification" subject="fox"
                    >“Oh!” said the Fox, “their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the
                    holt.”</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Now, the Goody stood and churned when the fox said this, but she thought she might as
            well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away <action actor="fox"
                subject="cream" sign="negative">the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the
                cream.</action> So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage,
            that <descriptor speaker="storyteller" subject="fox" sign="negative"><action
                    actor="woman" subject="fox" sign="negative">she snatched up the little morsel of
                    the cream that was left, and threw it at the fox as he ran off,</action> so that
                he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that’s the reason why the fox has a
                white tip to his brush.</descriptor></p>
