                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-1.svg"-->
                    <p>This graph shows the positive, negative, and neutral actions of characters in
                        "Boots And His Brothers". Boots is the most active character, followed by
                        his brothers as these interactions drove the narrative. The brothers,
                        father, and King all have negative actions as their purpose in the tale is
                        to doubt Boots. Each of the objects have positive actions as their purpose
                        is to assist boots. Boots has mostly neutral actions as he does not need to
                        do anything positive to complete the task he simply did what felt
                        natural.</p>

                    <p>This graph shows how the characters are described in "Boots And His
                        Brothers". The only character who recieved significant description is the
                        father, who was described to have a poor life to set up the need to
                        accomplish the King's task. The other characters recieve neutral
                        descriptions and are defined by their actions.</p>

                    <p>This graph shows the positive, negative, and neutral actions of characters in
                        "Boots And The Troll". Boots is the most active character as well as the
                        only character with positive actions. The troll has the most negative
                        actions, followed by the brother. This makes sense as the Troll literally
                        tried to kill Boots and the brother was setting Boots up for the Troll. The
                        other characters are not very active and are either negatively doubting
                        Boots or neutrally observing the situation. </p>

                    <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-2.svg"-->
                    <p>This graph shows how the characters are described in "Boots And The Troll".
                        The descriptors fit the expectation as Boots is heavily positive as he is
                        the hero of the tale and the brother is heavily negative as he attempts to
                        set Boots up to die. The family recieved negative descriptors as well to set
                        up Boots and his brothers as coming from a struggling family. </p>

                        "Boots Who Ate A Match With The Troll". Suprisingly, the Troll and the
                        family members have the same amount of negative actions. This is because
                        while the Troll was threatening, once he was tricked by Boots he was neutral
                        and positive. This is seen as Boots and the Troll together have only
                        positive actions. Boot's family had negative actions because they doubted
                        him.</p>

                        With The Troll". The only character described in this tale is the father,
                        who is described negatively to show that the family is struggling
                        financially making it more important to defeat the Troll. The other
                        characters are defined by their actions. </p>

                        characters in "Boots, Who Made The Princess Say, "That's A Story"". The only
                        character who truly acts in this tale is Boots, and his actions are positive
                        as he is able to tell the Princess a story that grasps her attention. All
                        other attempts would be considered neutral.</p>

                        Princess Say, "That's A Story"". The only character who is described in this
                        tale is the Princess and she is described negativly as the goal of the tale
                        is to change or prove wrong her negative description.</p>

                    <h2>East O'The Sun And West O' The Moon</h2>
                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-5.svg"-->
                    <p>From this graph, it is clear that the Winds’ actions are looked at in a
                        positive light. This makes sense, as they are aiding the daughter to find
                        the castle throughout the story. When examining the actions of the White
                        Bear/Prince, it seems as though the Prince’s actions are characterized as
                        more positive overall. That is not to say that in his bear form he is
                        conveyed as purely negative, but in this instance, it can be claimed that he
                        is more strictly positive in his human form. It also makes sense that the
                        actions of the daughter are positive, while the stepmother and Princess (who
                        in this case is really a Troll) are looked at negatively.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-5.svg"-->
                    <p>When examining descriptors in this tale, the results largely align with those
                        of the characters’ actions. The Winds are again described in a positive
                        manner, although the narrator does cast the North Wind in a negative light.
                        However, when the South Wind describes the North Wind, it is overwhelmingly
                        positive, as in the last graph. Here, both the White Bear and the Prince are
                        described positively by the narrator. Similar to the actions, the Prince’s
                        descriptors have a stronger positive relationship than that of the bear.
                        Curiously, the only descriptors for the daughter are given by herself. These
                        are negative, as she is doubtful of herself throughout the story. Long Nose
                        (the troll Princess) is described negatively by all of those who spoke of
                        her, as are the Trolls that appear at the end of the story.</p>

                    <h2>Tatterhood</h2>
                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-7.svg"-->
                    <p>In the bar chart, we can see that are heroine, Tatterhood, had the most
                        number of positive actions. She has three times the number of positive
                        actions against any other character, supporting that in this tale she is the
                        heroine, along with her overall character being of a positive nature. In
                        this tale, there was no solid villain. The witches could be considered due
                        to them reeking havoc on Christmas eve, causing striff to Tatterhood’s
                        younger twin, however they only appear for a limited portion of the tale, so
                        not much data was collected from them. Overall, their action count only was
                        negative so we can assume our perception of the character being
                        bad/evil.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-7.svg"-->
                    <p>In this graph we are visualizing the character dynamics between other
                        characters. For the most part, other characters' perception of our heroine
                        is mostly thought as negative throughout the tale for they see her as being
                        ugly. It is not until the end of the tale where they can see Tatterhood is
                        indeed beatiful, however these misconceptions were not added to the graph so
                        in this case the misconceptions are irrelevant. The giant pink circle
                        connecting the Prince and Tatterhood indicated that the Prince spoke
                        negatively about Tatterhood on numerous occasions, along the lines of her
                        ugliness. However, when we compare the two graphs together, although many
                        spoke ill of Tatterhood, our heroine continued only to help others, seen by
                        her positive count in the action graph.</p>

                    <h2>The Cock And The Hen That Went To The Dovrefell</h2>
                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-8.svg"-->
                    <p>As is typical of the fox in folklore, the fox in this tale is overwhelmingly
                        negative. This makes sense, as he did roast the birds and feast on them at
                        the end of the tale. If the fox can be described as mischievous, then the
                        Duck and Hen can be described as innocent and good-hearted. The graph
                        illustrates this description, with both having overall positive actions.
                        Notably, the Hen has much more positive actions than the duck, which can be
                        explained by his heroic actions at the end of the tale.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-8.svg"-->
                    <p>While this story did not have many descriptors of the characters themselves,
                        the one description that does appear is of the “Fox’s Earth”. Being
                        described by the fox himself as overwhelmingly positive, this relationship
                        conveys the narcissism of the fox. From the last graph, it is made clear the
                        fox is a negative character, and this description shows the reader that he
                        views himself and his world in a positive light. Although the reader views
                        the fox as negative, it is interesting to see that he would beg to differ.

                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-9.svg"-->
                    <p>In <i>The Fox As Herdsman</i> tale, our “villain” is the fox for his duplicity.
                        The fox only demonstrates negative actions, such as eating all the animals
                        in the herd he was supposed to be watching, and later eating all of the
                        cream his boss, the woman was making. There was no hero for this tale, since
                        this tale was more for giving information as to why the end of a fox’s tail
                        is white compared to the rest of it’s body.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-9.svg"-->
                    <p>In the character dynamic chart, we can see that the fox is only perceived
                        negatively, correlating with its duplicitous nature, allowing us to assume
                        that foxes in Norse tales are presented as evil/bad.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-10.svg"-->
                    <p>From the action bar chart, we can see that Boots, our hero, demonstrated the
                        most number of positive actions, correlating with the title of being a hero.
                        He goes on a journey to save his siblings from a Giant, and is able to do so
                        with the aid of a Princess. Typically in Norse mythology, giant’s are
                        perceived as the enemy of humans, only causing chaos or malice towards them.
                        This perception is also seen in the bar chart for the Giant has the most
                        number of negative actions, such as freezing our hero’s brother along with
                        their wives into stone. The only positive action of the Giant is when he
                        returns the brothers to their human form, however that is only because he is
                        blackmailed into doing so, not of his own volition.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-10.svg"-->
                    <p>Based on the character dynamics graph, we can see that our villain, the Giant
                        is most spoken about negatively. The only time he is spoken about positively
                        is during his death when he explodes, for the death of a giant is better for
                        the humans. Our hero, Boots is only perceieved in a postive nature,
                        correlating with the assumption that he is good/righteous. The Princess, or
                        heroine, is also spoken about in a positive manner, correlating with the
                        assumption that she is also good.</p>

                    <!--#include virtual="tale-number-11.svg"-->
                    <p>Immediately, it is notable that the actions of the North Wind are cast in a
                        negative light. This makes sense, as in the beginning of the story, he is
                        not initially cooperative with the lad. However, as the story goes on, it is
                        clear that he does want to help the lad. Because of this, the graph can be a
                        bit misleading in fully conveying the actions of the North Wind. The lad
                        himself has a mix of positive and negative actions, although there are
                        slightly more negative. This is reasonable, as he does partake in what can
                        be seen as negative actions. There is some nuance in this however, as his
                        negative actions are not done maliciously, but out of necessity. The
                        landlord, on the other hand, does conduct his negative actions in a
                        malicious manner, thus justifying the amount of negativity present on the
                        graph.</p>

                    <p>For descriptors, the North Wind is again described in a negative manner by
                        the narrator. However, lending some credence to the idea that this outcome
                        might be a bit misleading, the lad speaks of the North Wind in an overall
                        positive manner. This makes sense, as the North Wind does display gracious
                        qualities throughout the tale. The landlord is again spoken about in a
                        negative manner, further illustrating his nature of mischievousness.</p>
