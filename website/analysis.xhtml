                    <div id='BOOTSANDHISBROTHERS' style="display: none;">
                          <h2>Boots And His Brothers</h2>
                        <!--#include virtual="tale-number-1.svg"-->
                        <p>This graph shows the positive, negative, and neutral actions of characters in "Boots And His Brothers". Boots is the most active character, followed by his brothers as these interactions drove the narrative. The brothers, father, and King all have negative actions as their purpose in the tale is to doubt Boots. Each of the objects have positive actions as their purpose is to assist boots. Boots has mostly neutral actions as he does not need to do anything positive to complete the task he simply did what felt natural.</p>
                        
                        <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-1.svg"-->
                          <p>This graph shows how the characters are described in "Boots And His Brothers". The only character who recieved significant description is the father, who was described to have a poor life to set up the need to accomplish the King's task. The other characters recieve neutral descriptions and are defined by their actions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id='BOOTSANDTHETROLL' style="display: none;">
                          <h2>Boots And The Troll</h2>
                        <!--#include virtual="tale-number-2.svg"-->
                        <p>This graph shows the positive, negative, and neutral actions of characters in "Boots And The Troll". Boots is the most active character as well as the only character with positive actions. The troll has the most negative actions, followed by the brother. This makes sense as the Troll literally tried to kill Boots and the brother was setting Boots up for the Troll. The other characters are not very active and are either negatively doubting Boots or neutrally observing the situation. </p>
                        
                        <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-2.svg"-->
                          <p>This graph shows how the characters are described in "Boots And The Troll". The descriptors fit the expectation as Boots is heavily positive as he is the hero of the tale and the brother is heavily negative as he attempts to set Boots up to die. The family recieved negative descriptors as well to set up Boots and his brothers as coming from a struggling family.  </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id='BOOTSWHOATEAMATCHWITHTHETROLL' style="display: none;">
                          <h2>Boots Who Ate A Match With The Troll</h2>
                        <!--#include virtual="tale-number-3.svg"-->
                        <p>This graph shows the positive, negative, and neutral actions of character in "Boots Who Ate A Match With The Troll". Suprisingly, the Troll and the family members have the same amount of negative actions. This is because while the Troll was threatening, once he was tricked by Boots he was neutral and positive. This is seen as Boots and the Troll together have only positive actions. Boot's family had negative actions because they doubted him.</p>
                        
                        <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-3.svg"-->
                          <p>This graph shows how the characters are described in "Boots Who Ate A Match With The Troll". The only character described in this tale is the father, who is described negatively to show that the family is struggling financially making it more important to defeat the Troll. The other characters are defined by their actions.  </p>

                        <!--#include virtual="tale-number-4.svg"-->
                        <p>This graph shows the positive, negative, and neutral actions of the characters in "Boots, Who Made The Princess Say, "That's A Story"". The only character who truly acts in this tale is Boots, and his actions are positive as he is able to tell the Princess a story that grasps her attention. All other attempts would be considered neutral.</p>
                        
                        <!--#include virtual="descriptor-graph-4.svg"-->
                        <p>This graph shows how the characters are described in "Boots, Who Made The Princess Say, "That's A Story"". The only character who is described in this tale is the Princess and she is described negativly as the goal of the tale is to change or prove wrong her negative description.</p>
