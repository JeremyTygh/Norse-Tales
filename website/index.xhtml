                <p>
                    <span>Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so 
                        many children that he hadn’t much of either food or clothing to
                        give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest
                        was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no
                        end to her loveliness.
                        
                        So one day, ’twas on a Thursday evening late at the 
                        fall of the year, the weather was so wild and rough 
                        outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and 
                        wind blew, till the walls of the cottage shook again. 
                        There they all sat round the fire busy with this thing 
                        and that. But just then, all at once something gave three 
                        taps on the window-pane. Then the father went out to see 
                        what was the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what 
                        should he see but a great big White Bear.</span>
