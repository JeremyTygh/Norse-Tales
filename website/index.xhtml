                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p><em>Popular Tales from the Norse</em> were originally compiled and written by
                    Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe. Asbjørnsen, born 1812, was a zoologist
                    that conducted investigative voyages along the coasts and fjords of Norway. Moe,
                    born 1813, was a professor of theology and poet. The pair first met at Norderhov
                    Rectory, where they attended highshcool. As early as the 1830s, Asbjørnsen and
                    Moe discovered their mutual love for folklore, and began traveling different
                    regions of Norway to collect and compile fairy tales.</p>

                <p>In 1841, the duo first published the tales under the name <em>Norske
                        Folkeeventyr</em>. Following Norway’s independence in 1814, the work was
                    largely popular due to the country’s wave of nationalism in the 19th century.
                    The tales are often cited as having great influence on the Norwegian language.
                    At the time, Norwegian literature was heavily influenced by Danish, preventing
                    it from gaining popularity on a national level. Meanwhile, the many dialects
                    used to pass down these oral tales were much too localized. To solve this
                    dilemma, Asbjørnsen and Moe utilized the simple language style used by Grimm
                    when assembling their work. In 1859, George Webb Dasent, professor of English
                    literature at King’s College London, translated these tales to English.</p>

                    <h2>Research Question</h2>
                    <p>
                        When considering the Norse tales, our group decided to focus our research around characters and the perceptions regarding that character. 
                        We wanted to look at how characters can be understood differently depending on their actions or behavior, and how the perception the reader has,
                        can differ from other character's perceptions in the stories. To quantify this, we developed a main research question with various sub-questions
                        through these, listed later, we attempt to explore character's and their perceptions in the Norse Tales.
                    </p>

                        <em class="question">Throughout the Norse Tales how do characters' actions/traits influence the reader's perception of them in their stories?</em>
