                <h1>Project Description</h1>
                
                <p>This project analyzes Norse Tales in regards to how the various characters are described, how they interact, and what these findings might mean.</p>
                
                <h1>Research Questions</h1>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3>Throughout the Norse Tales how do characters' actions/traits influence the reader's perception of them in their stories?</h3></li>
                        <li>How do different species' actions/traits differ from each other?</li>
                        <li>How does transformation influence a character throughout their tale? Is the reader's perception of them altered post transformation?</li>
                        <li>Does the positivity/negativity of a character's actions/traits correlate directly to the character's overall positivity/negativity?</li>
                        <li>How are character interactions represented in terms of positivity and negativity in their descriptions?</li>
                    </ul>
