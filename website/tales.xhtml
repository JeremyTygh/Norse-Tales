         <h2>BOOTS AND HIS BROTHERS</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p><span class="descneu">Once on a time
                  there was a <span class="Father character">man</span> who had three sons,
                  <span class="Peter character">Peter</span>, <span class="Paul character">Paul</span>, and <span class="Boots character">John</span>. John was Boots, of course, because he was the
                  youngest.</span>
               <span class="descneg">I can’t say the man had
                  anything more than these three sons, for he hadn’t one penny to rub against
                  another</span>; <span class="actneg">and so he told his sons over and over again they must go out into
                  the world and try to earn their bread, for there at home there was nothing to be
                  looked for but starving to death.</span></p>
            
            <p>Now,<span class="descneu"> a bit off the man’s
                  cottage was the king’s palace, and you must know, just against the king’s windows
                  a
                  great oak had sprung up, which was so stout and big that it took away all the light
                  from the king’s palace.</span>
               <span class="actneu">The <span class="king character">King</span> had said he would give many, many dollars to the man who could
                  fell the oak, but no one was man enough for that, for as soon as ever one chip of
                  the oak’s trunk flew off, two grew in its stead</span>. <span class="actneu">A well, too, the King had dug, which was to hold water
                  for the whole year; for all his neighbours had wells, but he hadn’t any, and that
                  he
                  thought a shame. So the King said he would give any one who could dig him such a
                  well as would hold water for a whole year round, both money and goods; but no one
                  could do it, for the King’s palace lay high, high up on a hill, and they hadn’t dug
                  a few inches before they came upon the living rock</span>.</p>
            
            <p>But as the <span class="king character">King</span> had set his heart on having these two
               things done, he had it given out far and wide, in all the churches of his kingdom,
               that
               he who could fell the big oak in the king’s court-yard, and get him a well that would
               hold water the whole year round, should have the Princess and half the kingdom. Well!
               you may easily know there was many a man who came to try his luck; but for all their
               hacking and hewing, and all their digging and delving, it was no good. The oak got
               bigger and stouter at every stroke, and the rock didn’t get softer either. So one
               day
               <span class="actpos">those three brothers thought
                  they’d set off and try too, and their father hadn’t a word against it; for even if
                  they didn’t get the Princess and half the kingdom, it might happen they might get
                  a
                  place somewhere with a good master; and that was all he wanted. So when the brothers
                  said they thought of going to the palace, their father said “yes” at once. So Peter,
                  Paul, and Jack went off from their home.</span></p>
            
            <p>Well! <span class="actneu">they hadn’t gone far
                  before they came to a fir wood, and up along one side of it rose a steep hill-side,
                  and as they went, they heard something hewing and hacking away up on-the hill among
                  the trees</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“I wonder now what it is that is hewing
               away up yonder?” said Jack.</p>
            
            <p>
               “You’re always so clever with your
               wonderings”, said Peter and Paul both at once. “What wonder is it, pray, that a
               woodcutter should stand and hack up on a hill-side?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Still, I’d like to see what it is, after
               all”, said Jack; and <span class="actneu">up he went</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, if you’re such a child, ’twill do you
               good to go and take a lesson”, bawled out his brothers after him.</p>
            
            <p>But Jack didn’t care for what they said; <span class="actneu">he climbed the steep hill-side towards where the noise came, and when
                  he reached the place, what do you think he saw? why, an axe that stood there hacking
                  and hewing, all of itself, at the trunk of a fir.</span></p>
            
            <p>
               “Good day!” said Jack. “So you stand here all
               alone and hew, do you?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Yes; here I’ve stood and hewed and hacked a long
               long time, waiting for you”, said the <span class="Axe character">Axe</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, here I am at last”, said Jack,
               as <span class="actneu">he took the axe, pulled it off its
                  haft, and stuffed both head and haft into his wallet</span>.</p>
            
            <p>So when he got down again to his brothers, <span class="actneg">they began to jeer and laugh at him</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“And now, what funny thing was it you saw
               up yonder on the hill-side?” they said.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, it was only an axe we heard”,
               said Jack.</p>
            
            <p>So when they had gone a bit farther, they came under a steep spur of rock, and up
               there
               <span class="actneu">they heard something
                  digging and shovelling.</span></p>
            
            <p>
               “I wonder now,” said Jack, “what it is
               digging and shovelling up yonder at the top of the rock.”
               </p>
            
            <p>
               “Ah, you’re always so clever with your
               wonderings”, said Peter and Paul again, “as if you’d never heard a woodpecker
               hacking and pecking at a hollow tree.”
               </p>
            
            <p>
               “Well, well”, said Jack, “I think it would
               be a piece of fun just to see what it really is.”
               </p>
            
            <p>And so <span class="actneu">off he set to climb the rock,
                  while the others laughed and made game of him. But he didn’t care a bit for that;
                  up
                  he clomb, and when he got near the top, what do you think he saw? Why, a spade that
                  stood there digging and delving.</span></p>
            
            <p>
               “Good day!” said Jack. “So you stand here all
               alone, and dig and delve!”
               </p>
            
            <p>
               “Yes, that’s what I do”, said the Spade, “and
               that’s what I’ve done this many a long day, waiting for you.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, here I am”, said Jack again,
               as <span class="actneu">he took the spade and knocked it
                  off its handle, and put it into his wallet, and then down again to his
                  brothers.</span></p>
            
            <p>
               “Well, what was it, so rare and strange”,
               said Peter and Paul, “that you saw up there at the top of the rock?”
               </p>
            
            <p>
               “Oh,”, said Jack, “nothing more than a spade;
               that was what we heard.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So they went on again a good bit, till they came to a brook. They were thirsty, all
               three, after their long walk, and so <span class="actneu">they lay down beside the brook to have a drink</span>.</p>
            
            <p>
               “I wonder now”, said Jack, “where all this
               water comes from.”
               </p>
            
            <p>
               “I wonder if you’re right in your head”,
               said Peter and Paul, in one breath. “If you’re not mad already, you’ll go mad very
               soon, with your wonderings. Where the brook comes from, indeed! Have you never heard
               how water rises from a spring in the earth?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Yes! but still I’ve a great fancy to see where
               this brook comes from”, said Jack.</p>
            
            <p>So up <span class="actneu">alongside the brook he went,
                  in spite of all that his brothers bawled after him. Nothing could stop him. On he
                  went. So, as he went up and up, the brook got smaller and smaller, and at last, a
                  little way farther on, what do you think he saw? Why, a great walnut, and out of
                  that the water trickled.</span></p>
            
            <p>
               “Good-day!” said Jack again. “So you lie
               here, and trickle and run down all alone?”
               </p>
            
            <p>
               “Yes, I do,” said the Walnut; “and here have
               I trickled and run this many a long day, waiting for you.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, here I am”, said Jack, as he
               <span class="actneu">took up a lump of moss and
                  plugged up the hole, that the water mightn’t run out. Then he put the walnut into
                  his wallet, and ran down to his brothers</span>.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Well now”, said Peter and Paul, “have
               you found out where the water comes from? A rare sight it must have
               been!”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh, after all, it was only a hole it ran out
               of”, said Jack; and so <span class="actneg">the others laughed and made game of him again, but Jack didn’t mind
                  that a bit</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“After all, I had the fun of seeing
               it”, said he. So when they had gone a bit farther, they came to the
               king’s palace; but as every one in the kingdom had heard how they might win the Princess
               and half the realm, if they could only fell the big oak and dig the king’s well, so
               many
               had come to try their luck that the oak was now twice as stout and big as it had been
               at
               first, for two chips grew for every one they hewed out with their axes, as I daresay
               you
               all bear in mind. So the <span class="actneg">King
                  had now laid it down as a punishment, that if any one tried and couldn’t fell the
                  oak, he should be put on a barren island, and both his ears were to be clipped
                  off</span>. But the two brothers didn’t let themselves be scared by that; they
               were quite sure they could fell the oak, and Peter, as he was eldest, was to <span class="actneg">try his hand first; but it went with
                  him as with all the rest who had hewn at the oak; for every chip he cut out, two
                  grew in its place. So the king’s men seized him, and clipped off both his ears, and
                  put him out on the island</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Now <span class="actneg">Paul, he was to try his luck, but
                  he fared just the same; when he had hewn two or three strokes, they began to see the
                  oak grow, and so the king’s men seized him too, and clipped his ears, and put him
                  out on the island; and his ears they clipped closer, because they said he ought to
                  have taken a lesson from his brother.</span></p>
            
            <p>So now Jack was to try.</p>
            
            <p>“If you will look like a marked sheep, we’re
               quite ready to clip your ears at once, and then you’ll save yourself some
               bother”, said the King; for he was angry with him for his brothers’
               sake.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, I’d like just to try first”,
               said Jack, and so he got leave. Then <span class="actneu">he took his axe out of his wallet and fitted it to its haft</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Hew away!” said he to his axe; and
               <span class="actpos">away it hewed, making the chips
                  fly again, so that it wasn’t long before down came the oak.</span></p>
            
            <p>When that was done, <span class="actneu">Jack pulled out
                  his spade, and fitted it to its handle.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Dig away!” said he to the spade;
               and so the <span class="actpos">spade began to dig and
                  delve till the earth and rock flew out in splinters, and so he had the well soon dug
                  out</span>, you may think.</p>
            
            <p>And when <span class="actneu">he had got it as big and
                  deep as he chose, Jack took out his walnut and laid it in one corner of the well,
                  and pulled the plug of moss out</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Trickle and run”, said Jack; and
               so the <span class="actpos">nut trickled and ran, till
                  the water gushed out of the hole in a stream, and in a short time the well was
                  brimfull</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Then <span class="actpos">Jack had felled the oak which
                  shaded the king’s palace, and dug a well in the palace-yard, and so he got the
                  Princess and half the kingdom</span>, as the King had said; but it was lucky for
               Peter and Paul that they had lost their ears, else they had heard each hour and day,
               how
               every one said, “Well, after all, Jack
               wasn’t so much out of his mind when he took to wondering.”</p>

         <h2>BOOTS AND THE TROLL</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time <span class="descneg">there
                  was a poor man who had three sons. When he died, the two elder set off into the
                  world to try their luck, but the <span class="Boots character">youngest</span> they
                  wouldn’t have with them at any price</span>.</p>
            
            <p>
               <span class="misneg">“As for you”,
                  they said, “you’re fit for nothing but to sit and poke about in the
                  ashes.”</span>
               
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actneu">So the <span class="Elder Brothers character">two</span> went off and got places at a palace—the one
                  under the coachman, and the other under the gardener</span>. But
               <span class=" character">Boots</span>, <span class="actpos">he set off too, and took with him a great kneading-trough, which was the only thing
                  his parents left behind them, but which the other two would not bother themselves
                  with.</span> It was heavy to carry, but he did not like to leave it behind, and
               so, after <span class="actneu">he had trudged a bit,
                  he too came to the palace, and asked for a place.</span> So <span class="actneg">they told him they did not
                  want him,</span> but <span class="actneu">he begged so prettily that at last he got leave to be in the kitchen, and carry in
                  wood and water for the kitchen maid.</span>
               <span class="descpos">He was quick and ready,
                  and in a little while every one liked him</span>; but <span class="descneg">the two others were
                  dull, and so they got more kicks than halfpence, and grew quite envious of Boots,
                  when they saw how much better he got on.</span></p>
            
            <p>Just opposite the palace, across a lake, <span class="descneu">lived a Troll, who had seven silver ducks which swam on the lake, so
                  that they could be seen from the palace.</span> These the
               <span class=" character">king</span> had often longed for; and so the two elder brothers told
               the <span class=" character">coachman</span>:</p>
            
            <p>“If our brother only chose, he has
               said he could easily get the king those seven silver ducks.”
               </p>
            
            <p>You may fancy it wasn’t long before the coachman told this to the king; and the king
               called Boots before him, and said:</p>
            
            <p>“Your brothers say you can get me the silver
               ducks; so now go and fetch them.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“I’m sure I never thought or said anything of
               the kind,” said the <span class="Boots character">lad</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“You did say so, and you shall fetch
               them”, said the king, <span class="descpos">who would hold his own.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Well! well!” said the lad; “needs must, I
               suppose; but give me a bushel of rye, and a bushel of wheat, and I’ll try what I can
               do.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So <span class="actneu">he got the rye and the wheat, and
                  put them into the kneading-trough he had brought with him from home, got in, and
                  rowed across the lake.</span> When he reached the other side he<span class="actneu"> began to walk along the shore, and to
                  sprinkle and strew the grain, and at last he coaxed the ducks into his
                  kneading-trough, and rowed back as fast as ever he could</span>.</p>
            
            <p>When he got half over, the <span class="actneg"><span class=" character">Troll</span> came out of his house, and set eyes on
                  him.</span></p>
            
            <p>“HALLOA!” roared out the Troll; “is it you
               that has gone off with my seven silver ducks.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“AYE! AYE!” said the lad.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Shall you be back soon?” asked the
               Troll.</p>
            
            <p>“Very likely”, said the lad.</p>
            
            <p><span class="descpos">So when he got back to the
                  king, with the seven silver ducks, he was more liked than ever,</span> and
               even the king was pleased to say, “Well
               done!” But at this <span class="descneg">his brothers grew more and more spiteful and
                  envious;</span> and so they <span class="actneg">went and told the coachman that their brother had said, if he chose,
                  he was man enough to get the king the Troll’s bed-quilt, which had a gold patch and
                  a silver patch, and a silver patch and a gold patch;</span> and this time,
               too,<span class="actneu"> the coachman was not
                  slow in telling all this to the king</span>. So <span class="actneg">the king said to the lad, how his brothers had said
                  he was good to steal the Troll’s bed-quilt, with gold and silver patches; so now he
                  must go and do it, or lose his life.</span></p>
            
            <p>Boots <span class="actneg">answered, he had never thought
                  or said any such thing; but when he found there was no help for it, he begged for
                  three days to think over the matter</span>.</p>
            
            <p>So when the three days were gone, <span class="actneu">he
                  rowed over in his kneading-trough, and went spying about.</span> At last <span class="actneu">he saw those in the Troll’s cave come
                  out and hang the quilt out to air, and as soon as ever they had gone back into the
                  face of the rock,</span><span class="actneu"> Boots
                  pulled the quilt down, and rowed away with it as fast as he could.</span></p>
            
            <p>And when he was half across, <span class="actneg">out
                  came the Troll and set eyes on him, and roared out</span>:</p>
            
            <p>“HALLOA! Is it you who took my seven silver
               ducks?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“AYE! AYE!” said the lad.</p>
            
            <p>“And now, have you taken my bed-quilt, with
               silver patches and gold patches, and gold patches and silver patches?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Aye! aye!” said the lad.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Shall you come back again?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Very likely”, said the lad.</p>
            
            <p><span class="descpos">But when he got back with
                  the gold and silver patchwork quilt, every one was fonder of him than ever, and he
                  was made the king’s body-servant.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="descneg">At this, the
                  other two were still more vexed, and, to be revenged,</span> they went and
               told the coachman:</p>
            
            <p>“Now, our brother has said, he is man
               enough to get the king the gold harp which the Troll has, and that harp is of such
               a
               kind, that all who listen when it is played grow glad, however sad they may
               be.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Yes! the coachman went and told the king, and he said to the lad:</p>
            
            <p>“If you have said this, you shall do it. If you
               do it, you shall have the Princess and half the kingdom. If you don’t, you shall
               lose your life.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“I’m sure I never thought or said anything of
               the kind”, said the lad; “but if there’s no help for it, I may as well try; but I
               must have six days to think about it.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Yes! he might have six days, but when they were over, he must set out.</p>
            
            <p>Then <span class="actneu">he took a tenpenny nail, a
                  birch-pin, and a waxen taper-end in his pocket, and rowed across, and walked up and
                  down before the Troll’s cave, looking stealthily about him</span>. So when the
               Troll came out, he saw him at once.</p>
            
            <p>“HO, HO!” roared the Troll; “is it you who
               took my seven silver ducks?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“AYE! AYE!” said the lad.</p>
            
            <p>“And it is you who took my bed-quilt, with the
               gold and silver patches?” asked the Troll.</p>
            
            <p>“Aye! aye!” said the lad.</p>
            
            <p>So the <span class="actneg">Troll caught hold of him at
                  once, and took him off into the cave in the face of the rock.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Now, <span class="Troll Daughter character">daughter</span> dear”, said the Troll, “I’ve caught the fellow who stole
               the silver ducks and my bed-quilt, with gold and silver patches; put him into the
               fattening coop, and when he’s fat, we’ll kill him, and make a feast for our
               friends.”
               </p>
            
            <p>She was willing enough, and <span class="actneg">put him at once into the fattening coop, and there he stayed eight
                  days, fed on the best, both in meat and drink, and as much as he could
                  cram.</span> So, when the eight days were over, <span class="actneg">the Troll said to his daughter to go down and cut
                  him in his little finger, that they might see if he were fat. Down she came to the
                  coop</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Out with your little
               finger!” she said.</p>
            
            <p>But <span class="actpos">Boots stuck out his
                  tenpenny nail, and she cut at it</span>.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Nay! nay! he’s as hard as iron
               still”, said the Troll’s daughter, when she got back to her father; “we can’t take
               him yet.”
               </p>
            
            <p>After another eight days the same thing happened, and this time <span class="actneu">Boots stuck out his birchen pin</span>.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Well, he’s a little better”, she
               said, when she got back to the Troll; “but still he’ll be as hard as wood to
               chew.”
               </p>
            
            <p>But when another eight days were gone, the Troll told his daughter to go down and
               see if
               he wasn’t fat now.</p>
            
            <p>“Out with your little
               finger”, said the Troll’s daughter, when she reached the coop, and this
               time <span class="actneu">Boots stuck out the
                  taper end.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Now he’ll do nicely”, she
               said.</p>
            
            <p>“Will he?” said the Troll. “Well, then, I’ll
               just set off and ask the guests; meantime you must kill him, and roast half and boil
               half.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So when the Troll had been gone a little while, <span class="actneu">the daughter began to sharpen a great long
                  knife</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Is that what you’re going to kill me
               with?” asked the lad.</p>
            
            <p>“Yes it is,” said she.</p>
            
            <p>“But it isn’t sharp”, said the lad. “Just let
               me sharpen it for you, and then you’ll find it easier work to kill me.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actneu">So she let him have the
                  knife, and he began to rub and sharpen it on the whetstone.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>“Just let me try it on one of your hair
               plaits; I think it’s about right now.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So he got leave to do
                  that; but at the same time that he grasped the plait of hair, he pulled back her
                  head, and at one gash, cut off the Troll’s daughter’s head; and half of her he
                  roasted and half of her he boiled, and served it all up.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">After that he dressed himself in
                  her clothes, and sat away in the corner.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>So when the <span class="actneu">Troll came home with his
                  guests, he called out to his daughter—for he thought all the time it was his
                  daughter—to come and take a snack.</span></p>
            
            <p>“No, thank you”, said the lad, “I don’t care
               for food, I’m so sad and downcast.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh!” said the Troll, “if that’s all, you know
               the cure; take the harp, and play a tune on it.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Yes!” said the lad; “but where has it got to;
               I can’t find it.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Why, you know well enough”, said the Troll;
               “you used it last; where should it be but over the door yonder?
               </p>
            
            <p>The lad did not wait to be told twice; <span class="actpos">he took down the harp, and went in and out playing tunes; but, all
                  at once he shoved off the kneading-trough, jumped into it, and rowed off, so that
                  the foam flew around the trough</span>.</p>
            
            <p>After a while the Troll thought his daughter was a long while gone,<span class="actneg"> and went out to see what ailed her; and then he saw
                  the lad in the trough, far, far out on the lake</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“HALLOA! Is it you”, he roared, “that took my
               seven silver ducks?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“AYE, AYE!” said the lad.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Is it you that took my bed-quilt, with the
               gold and silver patches.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Yes!” said the lad.</p>
            
            <p>“And now you have taken off my gold
               harp?” screamed the Troll.</p>
            
            <p>“Yes!” said the lad; “I’ve got it, sure
               enough.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“And haven’t I eaten you up after all,
               then?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“No, no! ’twas your own daughter you
               ate”, answered the lad.</p>
            
            <p>But <span class="actneg">when the Troll heard that, he
                  was so sorry, he burst</span>; and then <span class="actpos">Boots rowed back, and took a whole heap of gold and silver with him,
                  as much as the trough could carry. And so, when he came to the palace with the gold
                  harp, he got the Princess and half the kingdom, as the king had promised him; and,
                  as for his brothers, he treated them well, for he thought they had only wished his
                  good when they said what they had said.</span></p>

         <h2>BOOTS WHO ATE A MATCH WITH THE TROLL</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p><span class="descneu">Once on a time there was a
                  <span class=" character">farmer</span> who had <span class=" character">three sons</span>; his
                  means were small, and he was old and weak, and his <span class=" character">sons</span>
                  <span class="actneg">would take to
                     nothing.</span></span> A fine large wood belonged to the farm, and one day
               the <span class="actneu"><span class=" character">father</span>
                  told his <span class="Eldest,Middle, and Boots character">sons</span> to go and hew
                  wood, and try to pay off some of his debts.</span></p>
            
            <p>Well, <span class="actpos">after a long talk he got them
                  to set off</span>, and <span class=" character">the eldest</span> was to go first. But when
               he had <span class="actneu">got well into the wood,
                  and began to hew at a mossy old fir, what should he see coming up to him but a great
                  sturdy <span class=" character">Troll</span>.</span></p>
            
            <p>“If you hew in this wood of mine”, said
               the <span class=" character">Troll</span>, “I’ll kill you!”
               </p>
            
            <p>When the <span class="Eldest character">lad</span>
               <span class="actneu">heard that, he threw the axe down, and
                  ran off home as fast as he could lay legs to the ground</span>; so he came in
               quite out of breath, and told them what had happened, but his
               <span class=" character">father</span>
               <span class="actneg">called him
                  “hare-heart”</span>—no <span class=" character">Troll</span> would ever have scared him
               from hewing when he was young, he said.</p>
            
            <p>Next day the <span class="Middle character">second son's</span> turn came, and he fared
               just the same. <span class="actneu">He had scarce hewn
                  three strokes at the fir, before the <span class=" character">Troll</span> came to him
                  too</span>, and said:</p>
            
            <p>“If you hew in this wood of mine, I’ll
               kill you.”
               </p>
            
            <p>The <span class="Middle character">lad</span> dared not so much as look at him, but <span class="actneg">threw down the axe, took to his heels,
                  and came scampering home just like his <span class=" character">brother</span>.</span> So
               when he got home, his <span class=" character">father</span> was angry again, and said no
               <span class=" character">Troll</span> had ever scared him when he was young.</p>
            
            <p>The third day <span class=" character">Boots</span> wanted to set off.</p>
            
            <p><span class="misneg">“You, indeed!” said the <span class=" character">two elder
                     brothers</span>; “you’ll do it bravely, no doubt! you, who have scarce
                  ever set your foot out of the door.</span>”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class=" character">Boots</span> said nothing to this, but only <span class="actneu">begged them to give him a good store of
                  food</span>. His <span class=" character">mother</span> had no cheese, so <span class="actpos">she set the pot on the fire to make
                  him a little, and he put it into a scrip and set off.</span> So when he had hewn a
               bit, the <span class=" character">Troll</span> came to him too, and said:</p>
            
            <p>“If you hew in this wood of mine, I’ll kill
               you.”
               </p>
            
            <p>But the <span class="Boots character">lad</span> was not slow; <span class="actpos">he pulled his cheese out of the scrip in a trice,
                  and squeezed it till the whey spurted out.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Hold your tongue!” he cried to the
               <span class=" character">Troll</span>, “or I’ll squeeze you as I squeeze the water out of
               this white stone.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Nay, dear friend!” said the
               <span class=" character">Troll</span>, <span class="mispos">“only spare me, and I’ll help you to
                  hew.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>Well, on those terms the <span class="Boots character">lad</span> was willing to spare him,
               and the <span class=" character">Troll</span>
               <span class="actpos">hewed so bravely, that
                  they felled and cut up many, many fathoms in the day.</span></p>
            
            <p>But when even drew near, the <span class=" character">Troll</span> said:</p>
            
            <p>“Now you’d better come home with me, for my
               house is nearer than yours.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So the <span class="Boots character">lad</span> was willing enough; and when they reached
               the <span class=" character">Troll</span>’s house, <span class="actpos">the <span class=" character">Troll</span> was to make up the fire, while the
                  lad went to fetch water for their porridge, and there stood two iron pails so big
                  and heavy, that he couldn’t so much as lift them from the ground</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Pooh!” said the <span class=" character">lad</span>,
               “it isn’t worth while to touch these finer-basins: I’ll just go and fetch the spring
               itself.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Nay, nay, dear friend!” said the
               <span class=" character">Troll</span>; <span class="mispos">“I can’t afford to lose my spring; just you make up the fire,
                  and I’ll go and fetch the water.</span>”
               </p>
            
            <p>So<span class="actpos"> when he came back with
                  the water, they set to and boiled up a great pot of porridge</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“It’s all the same to me”, said the <span class="Boots character">lad</span>; “but if you’re of my mind, we’ll eat a
               match!”
               </p>
            
            <p>“With all my heart”, said the
               <span class=" character">Troll</span>, for he thought he could surely hold his own in
               eating. So they sat down; but the <span class="Boots character">lad</span><span class="actneu"> took his scrip unawares to the
                  <span class=" character">Troll</span>, and hung it before him, and so he spooned more
                  into the scrip than he ate himself; and when the scrip was full, he took up his
                  knife and made a slit in the scrip.</span>
               <span class="actneu">The <span class=" character">Troll</span>
                  looked on all the while, but said never a word. So when they had eaten a good
                  bit longer, the <span class=" character">Troll</span> laid down his spoon, saying, “Nay!
                  but I can’t eat a morsel more.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>“But you shall eat”, said the <span class="Boots character">youth</span>; “I’m only half done; why don’t you do as I did,
               and cut a hole in your paunch? You’ll be able to eat then as much as you
               please.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“But doesn’t it hurt one cruelly?”
               asked the <span class=" character">Troll</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh”, said the <span class=" character">youth</span>,
               “nothing to speak of.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So <span class="actneg">the <span class=" character">Troll</span>
                  did as the <span class=" character">lad</span> said, and then you must know very well that he
                  lost his life</span>; but the <span class="Boots character">lad</span>
               <span class="actpos">took all the silver and
                  gold that he found in the hill-side, and went home with it, and you may fancy it
                  went a great way to pay off the debt</span>.</p>

         <h2>BOOTS, WHO MADE THE PRINCESS SAY, “THAT’S A STORY”</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time <span class="descneg">there
                  was a <span class="King character">king</span> who had a <span class="Princess character">daughter</span>, and she was such a dreadful story-teller that the like of
                  her was not to be found far or near.</span> So the king gave out, that if any
               one could tell such a string of lies, as would get her to say, “That’s a story”, he
               should have her to wife, and half the kingdom besides. Well, many came, as you may
               fancy, to try their luck, for every one would have been very glad to have the Princess,
               to say nothing of the kingdom; but they all cut a sorry figure, for the Princess was
               so
               given to story-telling, that all their lies went in at one ear and out of the other.
               Among the rest came three brothers to try their luck, and the two elder went first,
               but
               they fared no better than those who had gone before them. Last of all the third,
               <span class=" character">Boots</span>, set off and found the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>
               in the farm-yard.</p>
            
            <p>“Good-morning”, he said, “and thank you for
               nothing.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Good-morning”, said she, “and the same to
               you.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Then she went on:</p>
            
            <p>“You haven’t such a fine farm-yard as ours,
               I’ll be bound; for when two shepherds stand, one at each end of it, and blow their
               ram’s horns, the one can’t hear the other.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Haven’t we though!” answered Boots; “ours
               is far bigger; for when a cow begins to go with calf at one end of it, she doesn’t
               get to the other end before the time to drop her calf is come.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“I dare say!” said the Princess. “Well, but
               you haven’t such a big ox, after all, as ours yonder; for when two men sit one on
               each horn, they can’t touch each other with a twenty-foot rule.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Stuff!” said Boots; “is that all? why, we
               have an ox who is so big, that when two men sit, one on each horn, and each blows
               his great mountain-trumpet, they can’t hear one another.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“I dare say!” said the Princess; “but you
               haven’t so much milk as we, I’ll be bound; for we milk our kine into great pails,
               and carry them in-doors, and empty them into great tubs, and so we make great, great
               cheeses.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh! you do, do you?” said Boots. “Well, we
               milk ours into great tubs, and then we put them in carts and drive them in-doors,
               and then we turn them out into great brewing vats, and so we make cheeses as big as
               a great house. We had, too a dun mare to tread the cheese well together when it was
               making; but once she tumbled down into the cheese, and we lost her; and after we had
               eaten at this cheese seven years, we came upon a great dun mare, alive and kicking.
               Well, once after that I was going to drive this mare to the mill, and her back-bone
               snapped in two; but I wasn’t put out, not I, for I took a spruce sapling, and put
               it
               into her for a back-bone, and she had no other back-bone all the while we had her.
               But the sapling grew up into such a tall tree, that I climbed right up to heaven by
               it, and when I got there, I saw the Virgin Mary sitting and spinning the foam of the
               sea into pig’s-bristle ropes; but just then the spruce-fir broke short off, and I
               couldn’t get down again; so the Virgin Mary let me down by one of the ropes, and
               down I slipped straight into a fox’s hole, and who should sit there but my mother
               and your father cobbling shoes; and just as I stepped in, my mother gave your father
               such a box on the ear, that it made his whiskers curl.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="mispos">“That’s a story!” said the Princess; “my father
                  never did any such thing in all his born days!</span>”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So Boots got the
                  Princess to wife, and half the kingdom besides</span>.</p>

         <h2>EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was a poor <span class="Father character">husbandman</span> who had so many
               children that he hadn’t much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children
               they all were, but the prettiest was the <span class="Princess character">youngest daughter</span>, who
               was so <span class="descpos">lovely there
                  was no end to her loveliness.</span></p>
            
            <p>So one day, ’twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather
               was so
               wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till
               the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire busy with
               this
               thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane.
               Then the <span class="Father character">father</span> went out to see what was the matter; and, when he
               got out of doors, what should he see but a <span class="descpos">great big</span>
               <span class="White Bear character">White Bear.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Good evening to you!” said
               the White Bear. “The same to
               you”, said the man. “Will
               you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I’ll make you as rich as you are
               now poor”, said the Bear.</p>
            
            <p>Well, <span class="descneg">the man would not
                  be at all sorry to be so rich</span>; but still he thought he must have a bit
               of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a
               <span class="descpos">great</span>
               <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> waiting outside, who had given his word to make them
               so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter.</p>
            
            <p>The lassie said “No!” outright.
               Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with
               the
               <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span>, that he should come again the next Thursday
               evening and get an answer. Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling
               her
               of all the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and so at
               last
               she thought better of it, and <span class="actpos">washed</span> and <span class="actpos">mended</span> her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to
               start. I can’t say her packing gave her much trouble.</p>
            
            <p>Next Thursday evening came the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> to <span class="actneg">fetch</span> her, and she
               got upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had gone a bit
               of
               the way, the White Bear said: “Are you
               afraid?”
               “No! she wasn’t.”
               “Well! mind and hold tight by my
               shaggy coat, and then there’s nothing to fear”, said the Bear.</p>
            
            <p>So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill. There, on the
               face
               of it, the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> gave a knock, and a door opened, and they
               came into a castle, where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver
               and gold; and there too was a table ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could
               be. Then the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span>
               <span class="actpos">gave</span> her a silver
               bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only to ring it, and she would get it
               at
               once.</p>
            
            <p>Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got sleepy after her
               journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she <span class="actpos">rang</span> the bell; and she had scarce taken hold
               of it before she came into a chamber, where there was a bed made, as fair and white
               as
               any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains, and gold fringe.
               All
               that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had gone to bed, and put out
               the
               light, a <span class="Prince character">man</span> came and laid himself alongside her. That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast
               shape at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she
               had put out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things
               went
               on happily for a while, but at last she began to get <span class="descneg">silent</span> and <span class="descneg">sorrowful</span>; for
               there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and
               mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span>
               asked what it was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely there, and how
               she
               longed to go home to see her father and mother, and brothers and sisters, and that
               was
               why she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn’t get to them.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, well!” said the
               Bear, “perhaps there’s a cure for all
               this; but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother, but
               only when the rest are by to hear; for she’ll take you by the hand and try to lead
               you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and not do that, else you’ll bring
               bad luck on both of us.”</p>
            
            <p>So one Sunday the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> came and said now they could set off
               to see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his back; and
               they
               went far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and there her brothers and
               sisters were running about out of doors at play, and everything was so <span class="descpos">pretty</span>, ’twas a joy
               to see.</p>
            
            <p>“This is where your father and mother
               live now”, said the White Bear; “but don’t forget what I told you, else you’ll make us both
               unlucky.”
               “No! bless her, she’d not
               forget”; and when she had reached the house, the <span class="White Bear character">White
                  Bear</span> turned right about and left her.</p>
            
            <p>Then when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such <span class="descpos">joy</span>,
               there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her enough for all she
               had
               done for them. Now, they had everything they wished, as good as good could be, and
               they
               all wanted to know how she got on where she lived.</p>
            
            <p>Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. What
               she
               said beside I don’t know; but I don’t think any of them had the right end of the stick,
               or that they got much out of her. But so in the afternoon, after they had done dinner,
               all happened as the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> had said. Her mother wanted to
               talk with her alone in her bed-room; but she minded what the <span class="White Bear character">White
                  Bear</span> had said, and <span class="actneg">wouldn’t go</span> upstairs.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh! what we have to talk about, will
               keep”, she said, and put her mother off. But some how or other, her
               mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. So she said,
               how
               every night, when she had gone to bed, a <span class="Prince character">man</span> came and <span class="actpos">lay</span> down beside her as
               soon as she had put out the light, and how she never saw him, because he was always
               up
               and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about <span class="descneg">woeful</span> and
               sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him, and how all day long she
               walked about there alone, and how <span class="descneg">dull</span>, and <span class="descneg">dreary</span>, and lonesome it was.</p>
            
            <p>“My!” said her mother;
               “it may well be a
               <span class="Troll character">Troll</span> you slept with! But now I’ll teach you a lesson how
               to set eyes on him. I’ll give you a bit of candle, which you can carry home in your
               bosom; just light that while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on
               him.”</p>
            
            <p>Yes! she took the candle, and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew on, the
               <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> came and <span class="actneg">fetched</span> her away. But when they had gone
               a bit of the way, the <span class="White Bear character">White Bear</span> asked if all hadn’t happened as
               he had said? “Well, she couldn’t say
               it hadn’t.”</p>
            
            <p>“Now, mind”, said he,
               “if you have listened to your
               mother’s advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed
               between us will be as nothing.”</p>
            
            <p>“No”, she said, “she hadn’t listened to her mother’s
               advice.”</p>
            
            <p>So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story over again. There
               came a <span class="Prince character">man</span> and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when
               she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, <span class="actpos">lit</span> the candle, and let the light shine on
               him, and so she saw that he was the <span class="descpos">loveliest</span>
               <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love with
               him on the spot, that she thought she couldn’t live if she didn’t give him a kiss
               there
               and then. And so she did, but as she <span class="actpos">kissed</span> him, she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his
               shirt, and he woke up.</p>
            
            <p>“What have you done?” he cried;
               “now you have made us both unlucky,
               for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a
               <span class="Stepmother character">stepmother</span> who has <span class="actneg">bewitched</span> me, so that I am a White
               Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all ties are snapt between us; now I must
               set off from you to her. She lives in a Castle which stands EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST
               O’ THE MOON, and there, too, is a <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span>, with a
               <span class="descneg">nose three ells
                  long</span>, and she’s the wife I must have now.”</p>
            
            <p>She <span class="actneg">wept</span> and took it
               ill, but there was no help for it; go he must. Then she asked if she mightn’t go with
               him? No, she mightn’t. “Tell me the way,
               then”, she said, “and I’ll
               search you out; that surely I may get leave to do.”</p>
            
            <p>“Yes, she might do that”, he
               said; “but there was no way to that place.
               It lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON, and thither she’d never find her
               way.”</p>
            
            <p>So next morning, when she woke up, both <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> and castle were
               gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood,
               and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old
               home.</p>
            
            <p>So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and <span class="actneg">wept</span> till she was tired, she <span class="actpos">set out</span> on her way, and
               walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an <span class="Old Hag character">old
                  hag</span>, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Her the lassie
               asked if she knew the way to the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span>, who lived with his
               step-mother in the Castle, that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON, and who
               was to
               marry the <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span>
               <span class="descneg">with a nose three ells
                  long</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“How did you come to know about
               him?” asked the old hag; “but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?” Yes, she was.</p>
            
            <p>“So, so; it’s you, is it?”
               said the old hag. “Well, all I know about
               him is, that he lives in the castle that lies EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON,
               and thither you’ll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse,
               and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she’ll be able to tell you; and
               when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to
               be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you.”</p>
            
            <p>So she got upon the horse, and <span class="actpos">rode</span> a long long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat
               <span class="Old Hag character">another old hag</span>, with a gold carding-comb. Her the lassie
               asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON,
               and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it
               was
               east o’ the sun and west o’ the moon.</p>
            
            <p>“And thither you’ll come, late or
               never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she’ll
               tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left
               ear, and beg him to be off home.”</p>
            
            <p>And this <span class="Old Hag character">old hag</span> gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be
               she’d find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode
               a far
               far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which
               sat <span class="Old Hag character">another old hag</span>, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her,
               too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay
               EAST
               O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON. So it was the same thing over again.</p>
            
            <p>“Maybe it’s you who ought to have
               had the Prince?” said the old hag. Yes, it was.</p>
            
            <p>But she, too, didn’t know the way a bit better than the other two. “East o’ the sun and west o’ the moon it
               was”, she knew—that was all.</p>
            
            <p>“And thither you’ll come, late or
               never; but I’ll lend you my horse, and then I think you’d best ride to the
               <span class="East Wind character">East Wind</span> and ask him; maybe, he knows those parts, and
               can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch
               under the left ear, and he’ll trot home of himself.”</p>
            
            <p>And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. “Maybe you’ll find a use for it”, said the old hag.</p>
            
            <p>Then on she <span class="actpos">rode</span> many
               many days, a weary time, before she got to the <span class="East Wind character">East Wind</span>’s house,
               but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the <span class="East Wind character">East Wind</span> if
               he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east o’ the sun and west o’ the
               moon.
               Yes, the <span class="East Wind character">East Wind</span> had often heard tell of it, the
               <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> and the castle, but he couldn’t tell the way, for he
               had never blown so far.</p>
            
            <p>“But, if you will, I’ll go with you to
               my brother the <span class="West Wind character">West Wind</span>, maybe he knows, for he’s much
               <span class="descpos">stronger</span>. So, if you will just get on my back, I’ll carry you
               thither.”</p>
            
            <p>Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they <span class="actpos">went briskly</span> along.</p>
            
            <p>So when they got there, they went into the <span class="West Wind character">West Wind</span>’s house, and
               the <span class="East Wind character">East Wind</span> said the lassie he had brought was the one who
               ought to have had the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> who lived in the castle EAST O’ THE
               SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come
               with
               her, and would be glad to know if the <span class="West Wind character">West Wind</span> knew how to get
               to the castle.</p>
            
            <p>“Nay”, said the West Wind,
               “so far I’ve never blown; but if
               you will, I’ll go with you to our brother the <span class="South Wind character">South Wind</span>, for
               he’s much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide.
               Maybe he’ll tell you. You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you to him.”</p>
            
            <p>Yes! she got on his back, and so they <span class="actpos">travelled</span> to the <span class="South Wind character">South Wind</span>, and
               weren’t so very long on the way, I should think.</p>
            
            <p>When they got there, the <span class="West Wind character">West Wind</span> asked him if he could tell her
               the way to the castle that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON, for it was she
               who
               ought to have had the prince who lived there.</p>
            
            <p>“You don’t say so! That’s she, is
               it?” said the South Wind.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, I have blustered about in most
               places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I’ll take you to
               my brother the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>; he is the <span class="descpos">oldest</span>
               and <span class="descpos">strongest</span> of the whole lot of us, and if he don’t know where it
               is, you’ll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and
               I’ll carry you thither.”</p>
            
            <p>Yes! she got on his back, and away he <span class="actpos">went from his house</span> at a fine rate. And this time, too, she
               wasn’t long on her way.</p>
            
            <p>So when they got to the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>’s house, he was so <span class="descneg">wild</span> and
               <span class="descneg">cross</span>, cold puffs came from him a long way off.</p>
            
            <p>“BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU
               WANT?” he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it <span class="actneg">struck</span> them with an
               icy shiver.</p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said the South
               Wind, “you needn’t be so
               foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the <span class="South Wind character">South Wind</span>,
               and here is the <span class="Princess character">lassie</span> who ought to have had the
               <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> who dwells in the castle that lies EAST O’ THE SUN
               AND WEST O’ THE MOON, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can
               tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again.”</p>
            
            <p>“YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT
               IS”, said the North Wind; “once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but I was so
               tired I couldn’t blow a puff for ever so many days after. But if you really wish to
               go thither, and aren’t afraid to come along with me, I’ll take you on my back and
               see if I can blow you thither.”</p>
            
            <p>Yes! <span class="descpos">with all her
                  heart</span>; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way;
               and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn’t be at all afraid.</p>
            
            <p>“Very well, then”, said
               the North Wind, “but you must sleep
               here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we’re to get thither at
               all.”</p>
            
            <p>Early next morning the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> woke her, and puffed himself
               up, and blew himself out, and made himself so <span class="descpos">stout</span> and big, ’<span class="descneg">twas gruesome to look at
                  him</span>; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would
               never stop till they got to the world’s end.</p>
            
            <p>Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many
               houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds.</p>
            
            <p>So they tore on and on—no one can believe how far they went—and all the while they
               still
               went over the sea, and the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> got more and more weary,
               and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and
               drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his
               heels.</p>
            
            <p>“Are you afraid?” said the
               North Wind. “No!” she
               wasn’t.</p>
            
            <p>But they weren’t very far from land; and the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> had still
               so much strength left in him that he managed to <span class="actpos">throw</span> her up on the shore under the
               windows of the castle which lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON; but then he
               was so
               weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home
               again.</p>
            
            <p>Next morning the <span class="Princess character">lassie</span> sat down under the castle window, and
               began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the
               <span class="Long Nose character">Long-nose</span> who was to have the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“What do you want for your gold apple,
               you lassie?” said the Long-nose, and threw up the window. “It’s not for sale, for gold or
               money”, said the lassie.</p>
            
            <p>“If it’s not for sale for gold or money,
               what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price”, said
               the Princess.</p>
            
            <p>“Well! if I may get to the
               <span class="Prince character">Prince</span>, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you
               shall have it”, said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought.</p>
            
            <p>Yes! she might; that could be done. So the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> got the gold
               apple; but when the <span class="Princess character">lassie</span> came up to the Prince’s bed-room at
               night he was fast asleep; she called him and <span class="actpos">shook</span> him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she
               could do she couldn’t wake him up. Next morning as soon as day broke, came the
               <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span> with the long nose, and drove her out again.</p>
            
            <p>So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her
               carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span> asked
               what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn’t for sale for gold or money, but if
               she
               might get leave to go up to the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> and be with him that
               night, the <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span> should have it. But when she went up she
               found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she <span class="actpos">shook</span>, and <span class="actneg">wept</span>, and prayed, she couldn’t get life
               into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the
               <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span> with the long nose, and chased her out again.</p>
            
            <p>So, in the day time, the <span class="Princess character">lassie</span> sat down outside under the castle
               window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the
               <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up
               the window and asked what she wanted for it. The <span class="Princess character">lassie</span> said, as
               she had said twice before, it wasn’t for sale for gold or money; but if she might
               go up
               to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it.</p>
            
            <p>Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some
               <span class="Christians character">Christian folk</span> who had been carried off thither, and as they
               sat in their room, which was next the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span>, they had heard how
               a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running,
               and they told that to the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span>.</p>
            
            <p>That evening, when the <span class="Long Nose character">Princess</span> came with her sleepy drink, the
               <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> made as if he drank, but <span class="actpos">threw</span> it over his shoulder, for he could
               guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the <span class="Princess character">lassie</span> came in, she
               found the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> wide awake; and then she told him the whole
               story how she had come thither.</p>
            
            <p>“Ah”, said the Prince,
               “you’ve just come in the very nick of
               time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won’t have the
               <span class="Long Nose character">Long-nose</span>, and you are the only woman in the world who
               can set me free. I’ll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash
               the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she’ll say yes, for she doesn’t
               know ’tis you who put them there; but that’s a work only for <span class="Christians character">Christian
                  folk</span>, and not for <span class="descneg">such a pack of</span>
               <span class="Trolls character">Trolls</span>, and so I’ll say that I won’t have any other for my
               bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it.”</p>
            
            <p>So there was great <span class="descpos">joy</span> and <span class="descpos">love</span> between them all that night. But next day, when
               the wedding was to be, the Prince said: “First of all, I’d like to see what my bride is fit for.”
               “Yes!” said the step-mother,
               with all her heart.</p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said the Prince,
               “I’ve got a fine shirt which I’d
               like for my wedding shirt, but some how or other it has got three spots of tallow
               on
               it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride
               than the woman who’s able to do that. If she can’t, she’s not worth
               having.”</p>
            
            <p>Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose
               began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the
               bigger the spots grew.</p>
            
            <p>“Ah!” said the old hag,
               her mother, “you can’t wash; let me
               try.”</p>
            
            <p>But she hadn’t long taken the shirt in hand, before it got far worse than ever, and
               with
               all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and
               the
               darker and uglier was the shirt.</p>
            
            <p>Then all the other <span class="Trolls character">Trolls</span> began to wash, but the longer it
               lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over
               as
               if it had been up the chimney.</p>
            
            <p>“Ah!” said the Prince, “you’re none of you worth a straw you can’t wash.
               Why there, outside, sits a beggar <span class="Princess character">lassie</span>, I’ll be bound she
               knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN LASSIE!” he
               shouted.</p>
            
            <p>Well, in she came. “Can you wash this
               shirt clean, lassie, you?” said he. “I don’t know”, she said, “but I think I can.” And almost before she had taken it
               and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still. “Yes; you are the <span class="Princess character">lassie</span>
               for me”, said the Prince.</p>
            
            <p>At that the old hag <span class="descneg">flew into such a rage</span>, she burst on the spot, and the
               <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>
               <span class="descneg">with the long
                  nose</span> after her, and the whole pack of <span class="Trolls character">Trolls</span>
               after her—at least I’ve never heard a word about them since.</p>
            
            <p>As for the <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> and <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, they set
               free all the poor <span class="Christians character">Christian folk</span> who had been carried off and
               shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as
               far
               as they could from the Castle that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON.</p>

         <h2>TAMING THE SHREW</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was a <span class="King character">king</span>, and he had a
               <span class="Princess character">daughter</span> who was such <span class="descneg">a scold</span>, and whose tongue went so fast,
               there was no stopping it. So he gave out that the man who could stop her
               tongue should have the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> to wife, and half his kingdom into the bargain. Now,
               three brothers, who heard this, made up their minds to go and try their luck; and
               first
               of all the two elder went, for they thought they were the cleverest; but they couldn’t
               cope with her at all, and got well thrashed besides.</p>
            
            <p> Then <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>, the <span class="descneu">
                  youngest</span>, set off, and when he had gone a little way he found an ozier
               band lying on the road, and he picked it up. When he had gone a little farther he
               found
               a piece of a broken plate, and he picked that up too. A little farther on he found
               a
               dead magpie, and a little farther on still, a crooked ram’s horn; so he went on a
               bit
               and found the fellow to the horn; and at last, just as he was crossing the fields
               by the
               king’s palace, where they were pitching out dung, he found a worn-out shoe-sole. All
               these things he took with him into the palace, and went before the Princess.</p>
            
            <p> “Good day”, said he.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Good day”, said she, and made a wry face.</p> 
            
            <p>“Can I get my magpie cooked here?” he asked.</p>
            
            <p>“I’m afraid it will burst”,answered the Princess.</p>
            
            <p> “Oh! never fear! for I’ll just tie this ozier band round it”,
               said the lad, as he pulled it out.</p>
            
            <p> “The fat will run out of it”, said the Princess.</p>
            
            <p>“Then I’ll hold this under it”, said the lad, and showed her the piece of broken plate.</p>
            
            <p>“You are so <span class="descneg">crooked</span> in your words”
               , said the Princess, “there’s no knowing where to have you.”</p>
            
            <p> “No, I’m not crooked”, said the lad; 
               “but this is”, as he held up one of the horns.</p>
            
            <p> “Well!” said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, “I never saw the match of this in all my days.”</p>
            
            <p>“Why here you see the match to it”, said the lad, as he pulled out the other ram’s horn.</p>
            
            <p>“I think”, said the Princess, “you must have come here to wear out my tongue with your
               nonsense.”</p> 
            
            <p>“No, I have not”, said the lad; “but this is worn out”, as he pulled out the
               shoe-sole. To this the Princess hadn’t a word to say, for she had fairly lost her
               voice
               with rage. “Now you are mine”, said the lad; and so he got the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> to <span class="actpos">wife</span>, and
               half the kingdom.</p>

         <h2>TATTERHOOD</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was a <span class="King Queen character">king and a queen</span>
               <span class="descneu">who had no
                  children</span>, <span class="descneg">and that gave the queen much grief; she scarce had one happy
                  hour. She was always bewailing and bemoaning herself, and saying how dull and
                  lonesome it was in the palace.</span></p>
            
            <p>“If we had children there’d be life enough”,
               she said.
               </p>
            
            <p>Wherever she went in all her realm she found God’s blessing in children, even in the
               vilest hut; and wherever she came she heard the Goodies scolding the bairns, and saying
               how they had done that and that wrong. All this the queen heard, and thought it would
               be
               so nice to do as other women did. <span class="actpos">At last the <span class="King Queen character">king and queen</span>
                  took into their palace a stranger <span class="adopted daughter character">lassie</span> to rear up, that they might have her always with them, to
                  love her if she did well, and scold her if she did wrong, like their own
                  child.</span></p>
            
            <p>So one day the <span class="adopted daughter character">little lassie</span> whom they had
               taken as their own, ran down into the palace yard, and was playing with a gold apple.
               Just then an <span class="old beggar wife character">old beggar wife</span> came by, who
               had a <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">little girl</span> with her, and it
               wasn’t long before the <span class="adopted daughter character">little lassie</span> and
               the <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">beggar’s bairn</span> were great
               friends, and began to play together, and to toss the gold apple about between them.
               <span class="actneu">When the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> saw this, as she sat at a window in the palace,
                  she tapped on the pane for her foster-daughter to come up.</span> She went at
               once, but the beggar-girl went up too; and as they went into the Queen’s bower, each
               held the other by the hand. <span class="actneg">Then the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> began to scold the
                  little lady, and to say:</span></p>
            
            <p>“You ought to be above running
               about and playing with a <span class="descneg">tattered</span> beggar’s brat.”
               </p>
            
            <p>And so she wanted to drive the lassie downstairs.</p>
            
            <p>“If the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> only knew my mother’s power, she’d not drive me out”, said
               the <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">little lassie</span>;
               and when the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> asked what she meant more plainly,
               she told her how her
               mother could get her children if she chose. The <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> wouldn’t believe it, but the <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">lassie</span> held her own, and said every word of
               it was true, and bade the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> only to try and make
               her mother do it. <span class="actneu">So the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> sent the <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">lassie</span> down to fetch up her
                  mother.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Do you know what your daughter
               says?” asked the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> of the old
               woman, as soon as ever she came into the room.</p>
            
            <p>No; the beggar wife knew
               nothing about it.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, she says you can get me
               children if you will”, answered the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Queens shouldn’t listen to beggar
               lassies’ silly stories”, said the old wife, and strode out of the
               room.</p>
            
            <p>Then the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> got angry, and wanted again to drive
               out the <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">little lassie</span>; but she
               declared it was true every word that she had said.</p>
            
            <p>“Let the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> only give my mother a drop to drink,” said the <span class="beggar wife's daughter character">lassie</span>; “when she gets merry she’ll
               soon find out a way to help you.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">The <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> was ready to try this; so the <span class="old beggar wife character">beggar wife</span> was fetched up again once more,
                  and treated both with wine and mead as much as she chose; and so it was not long
                  before her tongue began to wag. Then the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span>
                  came out again with the same question she had asked before.</span></p>
            
            <p>“One way to help you perhaps I
               know”, said the beggar wife. “Your Majesty must make them bring in two pails of
               water some evening before you go to bed. In each of them you must wash yourself, and
               afterwards throw away the water under the bed. When you look under the bed next
               morning, two
               flowers will have sprung up, one fair and one ugly. The fair one
               you must eat, the ugly one you must let stand; but mind you don’t forget the
               last.”
               </p>
            
            <p>That was what the <span class="old beggar wife character">beggar wife</span> said.</p>
            
            <p><span class="actneu">Yes; the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> did what the beggar wife advised her to do; she had the water
                  brought up in two pails, washed herself in them, and emptied them under the bed; and
                  lo! when she looked under the bed next morning, there stood two flowers; one was ugly
                  and foul, and
                  had black leaves;
                  but the other
                  was so bright, and fair, and lovely, she had never seen its like;
                  so she ate it up at once. <span class="actneg">But the pretty flower tasted so sweet, that she couldn’t help
                     herself. She ate the other up too,</span> for, she thought,</span>
               “it can’t hurt or help one much either way,
               I’ll be bound”.</p>
            
            <p>Well, sure enough, after a while the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> was brought
               to bed. <span class="descpos">First of all, she
                  had a <span class="descneg">girl</span> who had a wooden spoon in her hand, and rode upon a goat;
                  loathly and ugly she was, and the very moment she came into the world</span>,
               she bawled out “Mamma”.</p>
            
            <p><span class="descneg">“If I’m your mamma”, said the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span>, “God give me grace to mend my
                  ways.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh, don’t be sorry”, said the girl, who
               rode on the goat, “for one will soon come after me who is better
               looking.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So, after a while, <span class="descpos">the
                  <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> had <span class=" character">another
                     girl</span></span>, <span class="descneu">who was so fair and sweet, no one had ever set eyes on such a lovely
                  child</span>, and with her you may fancy the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> was very well pleased. The <span class="descneu"><span class="descneu">elder twin</span> they called “<span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>”, because she was always so ugly and
                  ragged, and because she had a hood which hung about her ears in
                  tatters</span>. <span class="descneg">The <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> could scarce bear to look at her, and
                  the nurses tried to shut her up in a room by herself, <span class="descneu">but it
                     was all no good; where the younger twin was, there she must also be, and no one
                     could ever keep them apart.</span></span></p>
            
            <p>Well, one
               Christmas eve, <span class="descneu">when they were half grown up</span>, there rose such a frightful noise
               and clatter in the gallery outside the Queen’s bower.
               So <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> asked what it was that dashed and crashed so out in the
               passage.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh!” said the Queen, “it isn’t worth
               asking about.”
               </p>
            
            <p>But <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> wouldn’t give over till she found
               out all about it and so the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> told her it was a pack of Trolls and witches who
               had come there to keep Christmas.
               So <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> said she’d just go out and drive them away;
               and in spite of all they could say, and however much they begged and prayed her to
               let
               the Trolls alone, she must and would go out to drive the witches off; but she begged the <span class="Queen character">Queen</span> to mind and keep all the doors close shut, so that not one of
               them came so much as the least bit ajar. Having said this, <span class="actpos">off she went with
                  her wooden spoon, and began to hunt and sweep away the hags</span>; <span class="descneg">and all this while there was
                  such a pother out in the gallery, the like of it was never heard. The whole Palace
                  creaked and groaned as if every joint and beam were going to be torn out of its
                  place. Now, how it was, I’m sure I can’t tell; but somehow or other one door did get
                  the least bit ajar,</span>
               <span class="actneg">then <span class="younger twin character">her twin sister</span> just peeped out to see how things
                  were going with <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>, and put her head
                  a tiny bit through the opening. But, POP! up came an old witch, and whipped off her
                  head, and stuck a calf’s head on her shoulders instead; and <span class="descneg">so the <span class="younger twin character">Princess</span> ran back into the room on all-fours,
                     and began to “moo” like a calf.</span></span> When <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> came back and saw her sister, she scolded
               them all round, and was very angry because they hadn’t kept better watch, and asked
               them
               what they thought of their heedlessness now, when her sister was turned into a calf.</p>
            
            <p>“But still I’ll see if I can’t set her
               free”, she said.
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="descpos">Then she asked the King for a ship in full trim, and well fitted with stores; but
                  captain
                  and sailors she wouldn’t have. No; she would sail away with her sister all alone;
                  and as
                  there was no holding her back, at last they let her have her own way.</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">Then <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> sailed off, and steered her ship right
                  under the land where the witches dwelt, and when she came to the landing-place, she
                  told her sister to stay quite still on board the ship;</span>
               <span class="actpos">but she herself rode on her
                  goat up to the witches’ castle. When she got there, one of the windows in the
                  gallery was open, and there she saw her sister’s head hung up on the window frame;
                  so she leapt her goat through the window into the gallery, snapped up the head, and
                  set off with it. After her came the witches to try to get the head again, and they
                  flocked about her as thick as a swarm of bees or a nest of ants; but the goat
                  snorted, and puffed, and butted with his horns, and <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> beat and banged them about with her wooden spoon; and so
                  the pack of witches had to give it up.</span>
               <span class="actpos">So <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> got back to her ship, took the calf’s
                  head off her sister, and put her own on again, and then she became a girl as she had
                  been before.</span> After that she sailed a long, long way, to a strange king’s
               realm.</p>
            
            <p>Now the <span class="foreign king character">king</span> of that land <span class="descneu">was a widower, and had an
                  only son.</span>
               <span class="actneu">So when he saw
                  the strange sail, he sent <span class="foreign king's men character">messengers</span>
                  down to the strand to find out whence it came, and who owned it; but when the
                  <span class="foreign king's men character">king’s men</span> came down there,
                  <span class="descpos">they saw never a living soul on board but <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>, and there she was, riding round and round the deck
                     on her goat at full speed, till her elf locks streamed again in the
                     wind.</span></span> The folk from the palace were all amazed at this
               sight, and asked, were there
               not more on board?
               Yes, there were; she had a
               sister with her, said Tatterhood. Her, too, they wanted to see, but <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> said “No”:</p>
            
            <p>“No one shall see her, unless
               the king comes himself”, she said; and so <span class="descneu">she began to gallop about on
                  her goat till the deck thundered again.</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="actneu">So when the
                  servants got back to the palace, and told what they had seen and heard down at the
                  ship,</span>
               <span class="actneu">the <span class="foreign king character">king</span> was for setting out at once, that he might
                  see the lassie that rode on the goat. When he got down, <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> led out her sister, and she was so fair and gentle, the
                  <span class="descpos"><span class="foreign king character">king</span> fell over head and ears in
                     love with her as he stood. He brought them both back with him to the Palace, and
                     wanted to have the sister for his queen;</span></span> but <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> said “No”; the <span class="foreign king character">king</span> couldn’t
               have her in any way, unless the <span class="Prince character">king’s son</span> chose
               to have <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>. That you may
               fancy the <span class="descneg"><span class="Prince character">prince</span> was very loath to do,</span>
               <span class="descneg">such an ugly hussy as
                  <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> was;</span> but at last
               the <span class="foreign king character">king</span> and all the others in the palace
               talked him over, and he yielded, giving his word to take her for his queen; but it
               went
               sore against the grain, and he was a doleful man.</p>
            
            <p>Now they set about the wedding, both with brewing and baking; and when all was ready,
               they were to go to church; but the <span class="Prince character">prince</span> thought it
               the weariest churching he had ever had in all his life. <span class="descpos">First,
                  the <span class="foreign king character">king</span> drove off with his bride, and she
                  was so lovely and so grand, all the people stopped to look after her all along the
                  road, and they stared at her till she was out of sight.</span>
               <span class="descneg">After them
                  came the <span class="Prince character">prince</span> on horseback by the side of
                  <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>, who trotted along on her
                  goat with her wooden spoon in her fist, and to look at him, it was more like going
                  to a burial than a wedding, and that his own; so sorrowful he seemed, and with never
                  a word to say.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Why don’t you talk?” asked <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>, when they had ridden a bit.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Why, what should I talk about?”
               answered the <span class="Prince character">prince</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, you might at least ask me why I
               ride upon this ugly goat”, said <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Why do you ride on that <span class="descneg">ugly goat</span>?” asked
               the <span class="Prince character">prince</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Is it an ugly goat? why, it’s the
               grandest horse bride ever rode on”, answered <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>;
               <span class="mispos">and in a trice the goat
                  became a horse, and that the finest the <span class="Prince character">prince</span>
                  had ever set eyes on.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>Then they rode on again a bit, <span class="descneg">but the <span class="Prince character">prince</span> was just as
                  woeful as before, and couldn’t get a word out.</span>
               So <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> asked him again why he didn’t talk, and when
               the Prince answered he didn’t know
               what to talk about, she said:</p>
            
            <p>“You can at least ask me why I ride with
               this ugly spoon in my fist.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Why do you ride with that <span class="descneg"></span>ugly spoon? “asked the
               <span class="Prince character">prince</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Is it an ugly spoon? why, it’s the
               loveliest silver wand bride ever bore”, said <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>;
               <span class="mispos"> and in a trice it became a
                  silver wand, so dazzling bright, the sunbeams glistened from it.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>So they rode on another bit, <span class="descneg">but the Prince was just as sorrowful, and said never a
                  word.</span> In a little while, <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span> asked him
               again why he didn’t talk, and bade him ask why she wore that ugly grey hood on her
               head.</p>
            
            <p>“Why do you wear that <span class="descneg">ugly grey hood on your
                  head</span>?” asked the Prince.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Is it an ugly hood? why, it’s the
               brightest golden crown bride ever wore”, answered <span class="Tatterhood character">Tatterhood</span>,
               <span class="mispos"> and it became a crown on
                  the spot.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>Now, they rode on a long while again, <span class="descneg">and the Prince was so woeful, that he sat without sound or speech
                  just as before.</span>
               So his bride asked him again why he
               didn’t talk, and bade him ask now, why her face was so ugly and
               ashen-grey?</p>
            
            <p>“Ah!” asked the Prince, “why is
               <span class="descneg">your face so
                  ugly and ashen-grey</span>?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“I ugly”, said the bride; “you think my
               sister pretty, but I am ten times prettier”; and lo!<span class="mispos"> when the Prince looked at her,
                  she was so lovely, he thought there never was so lovely a woman in all the
                  world.</span> After that, I shouldn’t wonder if the Prince found his
               tongue, <span class="descpos">and no longer
                  rode along hanging down his head.</span></p>
            
            <p>So they drank the bridal cup both deep and long, and, after that, both <span class="Prince character">Prince</span> and King set out with their brides to the Princess’s
               father’s palace, and there they had another bridal feast, and drank anew, both deep
               and
               long. There was no end to the fun; and, if you make haste and run to the King’s palace,
               I dare say you’ll find there’s still a drop of the bridal ale left for you.</p>

         <h2>THE COCK AND HEN THAT WENT TO THE DOVREFELL</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was a <span class="Hen character">Hen</span> that had <span class="actpos">flown</span> up, and <span class="actpos">perched</span> on an oak-tree for the night.
               When the night came, she <span class="actpos">dreamed</span> that unless she got to the Dovrefell, the world would come to an
               end. So that very minute she <span class="actpos">jumped</span> down, and <span class="actpos">set
                  out on her way</span>. When she had walked a bit she met a
               <span class="Cock character">Cock</span>.</p>
            
            <p>"Good day,
               <span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky</span>", said the Hen. "Good day,
               <span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>", said the Cock, "whither away so early."
               "Oh, I’m going to the Dovrefell, that the world
               mayn’t come to an end", said the Hen. "Who told you that, <span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>", said
               the Cock. "I <span class="actpos">sat</span> in the oak and <span class="actpos">dreamt</span> it last night", said the Hen.
               "I’ll go with you", said the Cock.
               Well! they walked on a good bit, and then they met a <span class="Duck character">Duck</span>.
               "Good day,
               <span class="Duck character">Ducky-Lucky</span>", said the Cock. "Good day,
               <span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky</span>", said the Duck, "whither away so early?"
               "Oh, I’m going to the Dovrefell, that the world
               mayn’t come to an end", said the Cock. "Who told you that, <span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky</span>?"
               "Henny-Penny", said the Cock. "Who told you that,
               <span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>?" said the Duck. "I <span class="actpos">sat</span> in the oak and <span class="actpos">dreamt</span> it last night", said the Hen. "I’ll go with you", said the Duck. So they
               went off together, and after a bit they met a <span class="Goose character">Goose</span>. "Good day,
               <span class="Goose character">Goosey-Poosey</span>"”, said the Duck. "Good day,
               <span class="Duck character">Ducky-Lucky</span>", said the Goose, "whither away so early?"
               "I’m going to the Dovrefell, that the world
               mayn’t come to an end", said the Duck. "Who told you that, <span class="Duck character">Ducky-Lucky</span>?"
               asked the Goose. "<span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky.</span>"
               "Who told you that,
               <span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky</span>?"
               "<span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>."”
               "How you do know that,
               <span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>?" said the Goose. "I <span class="actpos">sat</span> in
               the oak and <span class="actpos">dreamt</span> it
               last night, <span class="Goose character">Goosey-Poosey</span>", said the Hen. "I’ll go with you", said the Goose. Now when
               they had all walked along for a bit, a <span class="Fox character">Fox</span> met them. "Good day,
               <span class="Fox character">Foxsy-Cocksy</span>", said the Goose. "Good day,
               <span class="Goose character">Goosey-Poosey</span>."
               "Whither away,
               <span class="Fox character">Foxy-Cocksy</span>?"
               "Whither away yourself,
               <span class="Goose character">Goosey-Poosey</span>?"
               "I’m going to the Dovrefell that the world mayn’t
               come to an end", said the Goose. "Who told you that, <span class="Goose character">Goosey-Poosey</span>?" asked the Fox.
               "<span class="Duck character">Ducky-Lucky</span>."
               "Who told you that,
               <span class="Duck character">Ducky-Lucky</span>?"
               "<span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky</span>."
               "Who told you that,
               <span class="Cock character">Cocky-Locky</span>?"
               "<span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>."
               "How do you know that,
               <span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>?"
               "I <span class="actpos">sat</span>
               in the oak and <span class="actpos">dreamt</span> last night, that
               if we don’t get to the Dovrefell, the world will come to an end", said the
               Hen. </p>
            
            <p>"Stuff and nonsense", said the Fox;
               "the world won’t come to an end if you don’t
               get thither. No! come home with me to my earth. That’s far better, for it’s
               <span class="descpos">warm</span> and <span class="descpos">jolly</span> there."</p>
            
            <p>Well, they went home with the <span class="Fox character">Fox</span> to his earth, and when they got
               in, the <span class="Fox character">Fox</span>
               <span class="actneg">laid</span> on lots of fuel, so
               that they all got very sleepy.</p>
            
            <p>The <span class="Duck character">Duck</span> and the <span class="Goose character">Goose</span>, they <span class="actpos">settled</span> themselves down in a
               corner, but the <span class="Cock character">Cock</span> and <span class="Hen character">Hen</span>
               <span class="actpos">flew</span> up on a post. So when
               the <span class="Goose character">Goose</span> and <span class="Duck character">Duck</span> were well asleep, the
               <span class="Fox character">Fox</span>, <span class="actneg">took</span> the <span class="Goose character">Goose</span> and laid him on the embers, and
               <span class="actneg">roasted</span> him. The
               <span class="Hen character">Hen</span>
               <span class="actpos">smelt</span> the strong roast
               meat, and <span class="actpos">sprang</span> up to a
               higher peg, and said, half asleep: "Faugh, what a
               nasty smell! What a nasty smell!"</p>
            
            <p>"Oh, stuff", said the Fox; "it’s only the smoke driven down the chimney; go to sleep
               again, and hold your tongue." So the <span class="Hen character">Hen</span> went off
               to sleep again.</p>
            
            <p>Now the <span class="Fox character">Fox</span> had hardly got the <span class="Goose character">Goose</span> well
               down his throat, before he did the very same with the <span class="Duck character">Duck</span>. He
               took and laid him on the embers, and <span class="actneg">roasted</span> him for a dainty bit. Then the <span class="Hen character">hen</span> woke up
               again, and <span class="actpos">sprung</span> up to a
               higher peg still. "Faugh, what a nasty smell! What
               a nasty smell!"</p>
            
            <p>She said again, and then she got her eyes open, and came to see how the
               <span class="Fox character">Fox</span> had <span class="actneg">eaten</span> both the twain, <span class="Goose character">goose</span> and
               <span class="Duck character">duck</span>; so she <span class="actpos">flew</span> up to the highest peg of all, and perched there, and
               <span class="actpos">peeped</span> up through the
               chimney.</p>
            
            <p>"Nay, nay; just see what a lovely lot of geese
               flying yonder", she said to the Fox.</p>
            
            <p>Out ran <span class="Reynard character">Reynard</span> to <span class="actneg">fetch</span> a fat roast. But while he was gone, the
               <span class="Hen character">Hen</span>
               <span class="actpos">woke up</span> the
               <span class="Cock character">Cock</span>, and <span class="actpos">told</span> him how it had gone with <span class="Goose character">Goosey-Poosey</span> and
               <span class="Duck character">Ducky-Lucky</span>; and so <span class="Cock character">Cocky-Lucky</span> and
               <span class="Hen character">Henny-Penny</span>
               <span class="actpos">flew</span> out through the
               chimney, and if they hadn’t got to the Dovrefell, it surely would have been all over
               with the world.</p>

         <h2>THE FOX AS HERDSMAN</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was a <span class="woman character">woman</span> who went out to hire
               a herdsman, and she met a <span class="bear character">bear</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Whither away, Goody?” said <span class="bear character">Bruin</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, I’m going out to hire a herdsman”,
               answered the <span class="woman character">woman</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said <span class="bear character">Bruin</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, why not?” said the <span class="woman character">woman</span>. “If you only knew how to call the flock; just let
               me hear?”
               </p>
            
            <p>“OW, OW!” growled the <span class="bear character">bear</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“No, no! I won’t have you”, said the <span class="woman character">woman</span>, as
               soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.
               </p>
            
            <p>So, when she had gone a bit further, she met a <span class="wolf character">wolf</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Whither away, Goody?” asked the <span class="wolf character">Wolf</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh!” said she, “I’m going out to hire a

               </p>
            
            <p>“Why not have me for a herdsman?” said the Wolf.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, why not? if you can only call the flock;
               let me hear?” said she.
               </p>
            
            <p>“UH, UH!” said the <span class="wolf character">Wolf</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“No, no!” said the <span class="woman character">woman</span>; “you’ll never do for

               </p>
            
            <p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a <span class="fox character">fox</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Whither away, Goody?” asked the <span class="fox character">Fox</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh, I’m just going out to hire a herdsman”, said
               the <span class="woman character">woman</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Why not have me for your herdsman?” asked the <span class="fox character">Fox</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, why not?” said she; “if you only knew how
               to call the flock; let me hear?”</p>
            
            <p>“DIL-DAL-HOLOM”, sung out the <span class="fox character">Fox</span>, in such a fine
               clear voice.</p>
            
            <p>“Yes; I’ll have you for my herdsman”, said the
               woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.</p>
            
            <p>The first day the <span class="fox character">Fox</span> was herdsman he <span class="actneg">ate up all the woman’s goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the
                  third day he ate up all her kine.</span> So, when he came home at even, the woman
               asked what he had done with all her flocks?</p>
            
            <p>“Oh!” said the <span class="fox character">Fox</span>, “their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the
               holt.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Now, <span class="woman character">the Goody</span> stood and churned when the fox said this, but she thought she might as
               well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away <span class="actneg">the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the
                  cream.</span> So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage,
               that <span class="descneg"><span class="actpos">she snatched up the little morsel of
                     the cream that was left, and threw it at the fox as he ran off,</span> so that
                  he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that’s the reason why the fox has a
                  white tip to his brush.</span></p>

         <h2>THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was a <span class="King character">king</span>
               <span class="descneu">who had seven sons, and he
                  loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one
                  must always be with him.</span> Now, when they were grown up, <span class="Princes character">six</span> were to set off to woo, but as for the <span class="descneu">youngest</span>, his father
               kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace.
               <span class="actpos">So the king gave the six the
                  finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long
                  way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred dollars, and so they
                  set off.</span><span class="descneu">
                  Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came
                  to a king who had <span class="princesses character">six daughters</span>; such lovely
                  king’s daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and
                  when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again</span>,
               <span class="actneg">but they quite forgot that
                  they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head
                  and ears in love with their own sweethearts.</span></p>
            
            <p>But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side,
               like a wall, where the giant’s house was, and there the <span class="Giant character">giant</span> came out, and set his eyes upon them, and <span class="actneg">turned them all into stone, princes
                  and princesses and all.</span>
               <span class="descneg">Now the king waited and
                  waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he
                  fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad
                  again.</span></p>
            
            <p>“And if I had not you left”, he said to
               <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>, “I would live no longer, so full of
               sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, but now I’ve been thinking to ask your
               leave to set out and find them again; that’s what I’m thinking of”, said <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Nay, nay!” said his father; “that leave you
               shall never get, for then you would stay away too.”
               </p>
            
            <p>But <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> had set his heart upon it; go he would; and
               he begged and prayed so long that the <span class="King character">king</span> was forced
               to let him go. <span class="descneg">Now, you
                  must know the king had no other horse to give <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their
                  train had carried off all his horses;</span> but <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his
               sorry-old-steed.</p>
            
            <p>“Farewell, father”, said he; “I’ll come back,
               never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me”; and with
               that he rode off.
               </p>
            
            <p>So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a <span class="Raven character">Raven</span>,
               <span class="descneu">which lay in the road
                  and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so
                  starved.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Oh, dear friend”, said the <span class="Raven character">Raven</span>, “give me a little food, and I’ll help you again
               at your utmost need.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“I haven’t much food”, said the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span>, “and I don’t see how you’ll ever be able to help
               me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So he gave the <span class="Raven character">raven</span> some of the food he had brought with him.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a
               <span class="Salmon character">great Salmon</span>, <span class="descneu">which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself
                  about, and could not get into the water again.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Oh, dear friend”, said the <span class="Salmon character">Salmon</span> to the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span>; “shove
               me out into the water again, and I’ll help you again at your utmost
               need.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well!” said the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span>, “the help you’ll give me will not be great, I daresay, but
               it’s a pity you should lie there and choke”; and with that <span class="actpos">he shot the fish out into the stream
                  again.</span></p>
            
            <p>After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>, which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on
               its belly.</p>
            
            <p>“Dear friend, do let me have your horse”, said the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>; “I’m so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I’ve
               had nothing to eat these two years.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“No”, said <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>, “this will never do; “first I came to a <span class="Raven character">raven</span>, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came
               to a <span class="Salmon character">salmon</span>, and him I had to help into the
               water again; and now you will have my horse. It can’t be done, that it can’t, for
               then I should have nothing to ride on.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Nay, dear friend, but you can help me”, said
               <span class="Wolf character">Graylegs the wolf</span>; “you can ride upon my back,
               and I’ll help you again in your utmost need.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well! the help I shall get from you will not
               be great, I’ll be bound”, said the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span>; “but
               you may take my horse, since you are in such need.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So when the <span class="Wolf character">wolf</span> had eaten the horse, <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>
                  took the bit and put it into the wolf’s jaw, and laid the saddle on his back;
                  <span class="descpos">and now the
                     <span class="Wolf character">wolf</span> was so strong, after what he had got
                     inside, that he set off with the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> like
                     nothing. So fast he had never ridden before.</span></span>
               </p>
            
            <p>“When we have gone a bit farther”, <span class="Wolf character">said Graylegs</span>; “I’ll show you the Giant’s
               house.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So after a while they came to it.</p>
            
            <p><span class="descneg">“See, here is the Giant’s house”, said the
                  <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>; <span class="actneg">“and see, here are your six
                     brothers, whom the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> has turned into
                     stone; and see here are their six brides,</span> and away yonder is the door, and in at
                  that door you must go.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>“Nay, but I daren’t go in”, said the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span>; “he’ll take my life.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“No! no!” said the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>; “when you get in you’ll find a Princess, and she’ll tell you
               what to do to make an end of the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>. Only mind
               and do as she bids you.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Well! <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> went in, but, truth to say, he was very
               much afraid. When he came in the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> was away, but
               in one of the rooms sat the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, just as the
               <span class="Wolf character">wolf</span> had said, <span class="descpos">and so lovely a princess <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> had never yet set eyes on.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Oh! heaven help you! whence have you
               come?” said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, as she saw him; “it
               will surely be your death. <span class="descneg">
                  No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for
                  he has no heart in his body.”</span>
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well! well!” said <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>; “but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do
               with him; and I will see if I can’t free my brothers, who are standing turned to
               stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well, if you must, you must”, said the
               <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>; “and so let us see if we can’t
               hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and
               I
               talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actneu">So he crept under the bed, and he had
                  scarce got well underneath it,</span> before the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> came.</p>
            
            <p>“Ha!” roared the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>, “what a smell of Christian blood there is in the
               house!”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Yes, I know there is”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, “for there came a magpie flying with a
               man’s bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get
               it
               out, but all one can do, the smell doesn’t go off so soon.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> said no more about it, and when night
               came, they went to bed. After they had lain awhile, the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> said:</p>
            
            <p>“There is one thing I’d be so glad to ask
               you about, if I only dared.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“What thing is that?” asked the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Only where it is you keep your heart,
               since you don’t carry it about you”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Ah! that’s a thing you’ve no business to
               ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill”, said the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Ho! ho!” said <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> to himself under the bed, “then we’ll soon see if we can’t
               find it.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Next morning the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> got up cruelly early, and
               strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before <span class="actneu"><span class="Boots character">Boots</span> and the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but
                  the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn’t find
                  it.</span></p>
            
            <p>“He has baulked us this time”, said the
               <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, “but we’ll try him once
               more.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So she picked all the
                  prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they
                  had laid in its right place again</span>; and when the time came for the
               <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> to come home again,<span class="actneu">
                  <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> crept under the bed.</span> Just as he
               was well under, back came the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Snuff—snuff, went the Giant’s nose. “My eyes
               and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here”, said
               he.</p>
            
            <p>“I know there is”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, “for there came a magpie flying with a
               man’s bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as
               I
               could to get it out, but I daresay it’s that you smell.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> held his peace, and said no more about
               it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the
               door-sill.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, I, of course”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all
               this?” said the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Ah!” said the Princess, “I’m so fond of
               you that I couldn’t help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under
               there.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“You don’t say so”, said the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>; “but after all it doesn’t lie there at
               all.”
               </p>
            
            <p>So when they went to bed again in the evening, the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> asked the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> again where
               his heart was, for she said she would so like to know.</p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>, “if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard
               against the wall.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“So, so!” thought <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> and the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>; “then we’ll soon try to find it.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Next morning the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> was away early, and strode off
               to the wood, and so soon as he was gone <span class="actneu"><span class="Boots character">Boots</span> and
                  the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span> were in the cupboard hunting for
                  his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, “we’ll just try him once more.”
               </p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So she decked out
                  the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come
                  home, <span class="actneu"><span class="Boots character">Boots</span> crept under the bed again.</span></span>
               </p>
            
            <p>Then back came the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Snuff-snuff! “My eyes and limbs, what a
               smell of Christian blood there is in here!”</p>
            
            <p>“I know there is”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>; “for a little while since there came a
               magpie flying with a man’s bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I
               made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains,
               I daresay it’s that you smell.”
               </p>
            
            <p>When the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> heard that, he said no more about it;
               but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers
               and
               garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all this
               tom-foolery?” asked the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, I’m so fond of you, I couldn’t help
               doing it when I knew that your heart lay there”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“How can you be so silly as to believe any
               such thing?” said the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when
               you say it”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p>“You’re a goose”, said the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>; “where my heart is, you will never
               come.”
               </p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>;” but for all that, ’twould be such a pleasure to know
               where it really lies.”
               </p>
            
            <p>Then the poor <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> could hold out no longer, but was
               forced to say:</p>
            
            <p>“Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on
               that island stands a church; in that church is a well; in that well swims a duck;
               in
               that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart,—you
               darling!”
               </p>
            
            <p>In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> strode off to the wood.</p>
            
            <p>“Yes! now I must set off too”, said
               <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>; “if I only knew how to find the
               way.” He took a long, long farewell of the <span class="Princess character">Princess</span>, <span class="actpos">and when
                  he got out of the Giant’s door, there stood the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span> waiting for him. So <span class="Boots character">Boots</span>
                  told him all that had happened inside the house, and said now he wished to ride to
                  the well in the church, if he only knew the way. So the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span> bade him jump on his back, he’d soon find the way; and away
                  they went, till the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and
                  dale. After they had travelled many, many days, they came at last to the lake. Then
                  the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> did not know how to get over it, but
                  the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span> bade him only not be afraid, but stick
                  on, and so he jumped into the lake with the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> on his back, and swam over to the island. So they came to
                  the church</span>; but
               the church keys hung high, high up on the top of the tower, and at first the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> did not know how to get them down.</p>
            
            <p>“You must call on the <span class="Raven character">raven</span>”, said the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>.</p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> called on the <span class="Raven character">raven</span>, and
                  in a trice the <span class="Raven character">raven</span> came, and flew up and
                  fetched the keys, and so the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> got into the
                  church</span>. But when he came to the well, there lay the duck, and swam about
               backwards and forwards, just as the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> had said.
               <span class="actpos">So the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> stood and coaxed it and coaxed it, till it came to him, and
                  he grasped it in his hand; 
                  but just as he lifted it up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well,
                  
                  and then <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> was
                  beside himself to know how to get it out again.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Well, now you must call on the <span class="Salmon character">salmon</span> to be sure”, said the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>; and the <span class="Boots character">king’s
                  son</span> called on the <span class="Salmon character">salmon</span>, <span class="actpos">and the <span class="Salmon character">salmon</span> came and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the
                  well.</span></p>
            
            <p>Then the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span> told him to <span class="actpos">squeeze the egg, and as soon as ever he squeezed it
                  the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> screamed out.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Squeeze it again”, said the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>; <span class="actpos">and when the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> did so, the
                  <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> screamed still more piteously,</span>
               and <span class="descneu">begged and prayed so
                  prettily to be spared, saying he would do all that the <span class="Boots character">Prince</span> wished if he would only not squeeze his heart in
                  two.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Tell him, if he will restore to life again your
               six brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone, you will spare his
               life”, said the <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>. Yes, the
               <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> was ready to do that, and <span class="actpos">he turned the six
                  brothers into king’s sons again, and their brides into king’s
                  daughters.</span></p>
            
            <p>“Now, squeeze the egg in two”, said the
               <span class="Wolf character">Wolf</span>.
               <span class="actpos"> So <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> squeezed the egg to pieces, <span class="descpos">and the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span> burst at once.</span></span>
               </p>
            
            <p>Now, when he had made an end of the <span class="Giant character">Giant</span>, <span class="descneu"><span class="Boots character">Boots</span> rode back again on the <span class="Wolf character">wolf</span> to the Giant’s house, and there stood all his six
                  brothers alive and merry, with their brides. Then <span class="Boots character">Boots</span> went into the hill-side after his bride, and so they all set
                  off home again to their father’s house.</span>
               <span class="descpos">And you may fancy how glad
                  the old king was when he saw all his seven sons come back, each with his
                  bride—</span><span class="descpos">“But the loveliest bride of
                  all is the <span class="Princess character">bride of Boots</span>, after all”,
                  said the <span class="King character">king</span>,</span><span class="descpos"> “and he shall sit uppermost at
                  the table, with her by his side.”</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="actpos">So he sent out, and called a
                  great wedding-feast,</span> and the mirth was both loud and long, and if they have not done
               feasting, why, they are still at it.</p>

         <h2>THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time there was an <span class="Old Widow character">old widow</span> who had one
               <span class="Son character">son</span>; and as she was <span class="descneg">poorly</span> and <span class="descneg">weak</span>, her son had
               to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe,
               and
               was just going down the steps, there came the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>, <span class="actneg">puffing</span> and <span class="actneg">blowing</span>, caught up the
               meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the lad went back into the safe for
               more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>
               didn’t come again and carry off the meal with a <span class="actneg">puff</span>; and, more than that, he did so the
               third time. At this the lad got very <span class="descneg">angry</span>; and as he thought it hard that the
               <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> should behave so, he thought he’d just look him
               up, and ask him to give up his meal.</p>
            
            <p>So off he went, but the way was long, and he <span class="actpos">walked</span> and walked; but at last he came to the
               <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>’s house.</p>
            
            <p>"Good day!" said the lad, and thank you for coming to see us
               yesterday.</p>
            
            <p>"GOOD DAY!" answered the
               <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>, for his voice was <span class="descneg">loud</span> and <span class="descneg">gruff</span>, "AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"</p>
            
            <p>"Oh!" answered the lad, "I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let
               me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven’t much to
               live on; and if you’re to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there’ll be nothing
               for it but to starve."</p>
            
            <p>"I haven’t got your meal", said the
               <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>; "but
               if you are in such need, I’ll give you a cloth which will get you everything you
               want, if you only say, “Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kind of good
               dishes!” "</p>
            
            <p>With this the <span class="Son character">lad</span> was well <span class="descpos">content</span>. But, as the way was so long he couldn’t get home
               in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down
               to
               supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said, "Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good
               dishes."</p>
            
            <p>He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought
               it
               a fine thing, but most of all the <span class="Landlady character">landlady</span>. So, when all were
               fast asleep at dead of night, she took the lad’s cloth, and put another in its stead,
               just like the one he had got from the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>, but which
               couldn’t so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.</p>
            
            <p>So, when the <span class="Son character">lad</span> woke, he <span class="actpos">took</span> his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his
               mother.</p>
            
            <p>"Now", said he, "I’ve been to the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>’s
               house, and a <span class="descpos">good</span> fellow
               he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, ‘Cloth, spread
               yourself, and serve up all kind of good dishes’, I get any sort of food I
               please."</p>
            
            <p>"All very true, I daresay," said
               his mother; "but seeing is believing, and I
               shan’t believe it till I see it."</p>
            
            <p>So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said: "Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kind of good
               dishes."</p>
            
            <p>But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.</p>
            
            <p>"Well", said the
               <span class="Son character">lad</span>, "there’s no
               help for it but to go to the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> again"; and
               away he went. So he came to where the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> lived late in
               the afternoon.</p>
            
            <p>"Good evening!" said the
               <span class="Son character">lad</span>. "Good
               evening!" said the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>. "I want my rights for that meal of ours which you
               took", said the lad; "for, as
               for that cloth I got, it isn’t worth a penny."
               "I’ve got no meal", said the
               <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>; "but
               yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to
               it: ‘Rain, ram! make money!’"</p>
            
            <p>So the <span class="Son character">lad</span> thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get
               home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before.</p>
            
            <p>Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the <span class="North Wind character">North
                  Wind</span> had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the
               <span class="Landlord character">landlord</span> saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when
               the <span class="Son character">lad</span> had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn’t coin
               gold ducats, and changed the two.</p>
            
            <p>Next morning off went the <span class="Son character">lad</span>; and when he got home to his
               <span class="Mother character">mother</span>, he said: "After all, the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span> is a jolly fellow; for now he has
               given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say ‘Ram, ram! make
               money.’"
               "All very true, I daresay", said
               his <span class="Mother character">mother</span>; "but I
               shan’t believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."</p>
            
            <p>"Ram, ram! make money!" said the
               <span class="Son character">lad</span>; but if the Ram made anything, it wasn’t money. So the
               <span class="Son character">lad</span> went back again to the <span class="North Wind character">North Wind</span>,
               and <span class="actneg">blew him up</span>, and said the ram was
               worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal.</p>
            
            <p>"Well!" said the <span class="North Wind character">North
                  Wind</span>; "I’ve nothing else to
               give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but it’s a stick of that kind that
               if you say: “‘Stick, stick! lay on!’ it lays on till you say: ‘Stick, stick! now
               stop!’"</p>
            
            <p>So, as the way was long, the <span class="Son character">lad</span> turned in this night too to the
               <span class="Landlord character">landlord</span>; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood
               as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to <span class="actneg">snore</span>, as if he were asleep.</p>
            
            <p>Now the <span class="Landlord character">landlord</span>, who easily saw that the stick must be worth
               something, <span class="descneg">hunted</span> up one
               which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but,
               just as the <span class="Landlord character">landlord</span> was about to <span class="actneg">take</span> it, the lad bawled out: "Stick, stick! lay on!"</p>
            
            <p>So the stick began to <span class="actneg">beat</span> the
               <span class="Landlord character">landlord</span>, till he <span class="actneg">jumped</span> over chairs, and tables, and benches, and <span class="actneg">yelled</span> and <span class="actneg">roared</span>: "Oh my! oh my! bid the
               stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your
               cloth and our ram."</p>
            
            <p>When the <span class="Son character">lad</span> thought the <span class="Landlord character">landlord</span> had got
               enough, he said: "Stick, stick! now
               stop!"</p>
            
            <p>Then he <span class="actpos">took</span> the cloth and put it into his
               pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, <span class="actneg">leading</span> the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for
               the meal he had lost.</p>

         <h2>THE MASTER THIEF</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once upon a time there was a <span class="Cottager character">poor cottager</span> who had
               three sons. He had nothing to leave them when he died, and no money with which to
               put
               them to any trade, so that he did not know what to make of them. At last he said he
               would give them leave to take to anything each liked best, and to go whithersoever
               they
               pleased, and he would go with them a bit of the way; and so he did. He went with them
               till they came to a place where three roads met, and there each of them chose a road,
               and their father bade them good-bye, and went back home. I have never heard tell what
               became of the two elder; but as for <span class="The Youth character">the youngest</span>,
               he went both far and long, as you shall hear.</p>
            
            <p>So it fell out one night as he was going through a great wood that such bad weather
               overtook him. It blew, and sleeted, and drove so that he could scarce keep his eyes
               open; and in a trice, before he knew how it was, he got bewildered, and could not
               find
               either road or path. But as he went on and on, at last he saw a glimmering of light
               far
               far off in the wood. So he thought he would try and get to the light; and after a
               time
               he did reach it. There it was in a large house, and the fire was blazing so brightly
               inside, that he could tell the folk had not yet gone to bed; so he went in and saw
               an
               <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span> bustling about and minding the
               house.</p>
            
            <p>“Good evening!” said
               <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Good evening!” said the
               <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Hutetu! it’s such foul weather out of
               doors to-night”, said he. </p>
            
            <p>“So it is”, said she.</p>
            
            <p>“Can I get leave to have a bed and
               shelter here to-night?” asked <span class="The Youth character">the
                  youth</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“You’ll get no good by sleeping
               here”, said the <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span>; “for if the folk come home and find you here,
               they’ll kill both me and you.”</p>
            
            <p>“What sort of folk, then, are they who
               live here?” asked <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, robbers! And a bad lot of them
               too”, said the <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span>. “They stole me away when I was little, and
               have kept me as their housekeeper ever since.”</p>
            
            <p>“Well, for all that, I think I’ll just
               go to bed”, said <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>.
               “Come what may, I’ll not stir out
               at night in such weather.”</p>
            
            <p>“Very well”, said the
               <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span>; “but if you stay, it will be the worse for you.”</p>
            
            <p>With that <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> got into a bed which stood
               there, but he dared not go to sleep, and very soon after in came <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span>; so the <span class="Old Dame character">old
                  dame</span> told them how a stranger fellow had come in whom she had not been
               able to get out of the house again.</p>
            
            <p>“Did you see if he had any
               money?” said <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Such a one as he money!” said
               the <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span>, “<span class="descneg">the tramper</span>! Why, if he had clothes to his back, it
               was as much as he had.”</p>
            
            <p>Then <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span> began to talk among themselves what
               they should do with him; if they should kill him outright, or what else they should
               do.
               Meantime <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> got up and began to talk to
               them, and to ask if they didn’t want a servant, for it might be that <span class="actpos">he would be glad to enter their
                  service</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh”, said they, “if you have a mind to follow the trade that
               we follow, you can very well get a place here.”</p>
            
            <p>“It’s all one to me what trade I
               follow”, said <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>; “for when I left home, father gave me leave to
               take to any trade I chose.”</p>
            
            <p>“Well, have you a mind to
               steal?” asked the robbers.</p>
            
            <p>“I don’t care”, said
               <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>, for he thought it would not take
               long to learn that trade.</p>
            
            <p>Now there lived<span class="Rancher character"> a man a little way off who had three
                  oxen</span>. One of these he was to take to the town to sell, and <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span> had heard what he was going to do, so they
               said to <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>, if he were good to steal the
               ox from the man by the way without his knowing it, and without doing him any harm,
               they
               would give him leave to be their serving-man.</p>
            
            <p>Well! <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> set off, and <span class="actneg">took</span> with him a pretty
               shoe, with a silver buckle on it, which lay about the house; and he put the shoe in
               the
               road along which <span class="Rancher character">the man</span> was going with his ox; and
               when he had done that, he went into the wood and hid himself under a bush. So when
               the
               man came by he saw the shoe at once.</p>
            
            <p>“That’s a nice shoe”, said he.
               “If I only had the fellow to it, I’d take
               it home with me, and perhaps I’d put my <span class="Rancher's Wife character">old
                  dame</span> in a good humour for once.” For you must know he had
               an old wife, so <span class="descneg">cross and snappish</span>, it was not long between each time that she boxed
               his ears. But then he bethought him that he could do nothing with the odd shoe unless
               he
               had the fellow to it; so he went on his way and let the shoe lie on the road.</p>
            
            <p>Then <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> took up the shoe, and made all the
               haste he could to get before the man by a short cut through the wood, and laid it
               down
               before him in the road again. When the man came along with his ox, <span class="actneg">he got quite angry with
                  himself</span> for being so <span class="descneg">dull</span> as to leave the fellow to the shoe lying in the
               road instead of taking it with him; so he tied the ox to the fence, and said to himself,
               “I may just as well run back and pick up
               the other, and then I’ll have a pair of good shoes for my <span class="Rancher's Wife character">old dame</span>, and so, perhaps, I’ll get a kind word
               from her for once.”</p>
            
            <p>So he set off, and hunted and hunted up and down for the shoe, but no shoe did he
               find;
               and at length he had to go back with the one he had. But, meanwhile <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> had <span class="actneg">taken the ox</span> and gone off with it; and
               when the man came and saw his ox gone, he began to cry and bewail, for he was afraid
               his
               <span class="Rancher's Wife character">old dame</span> would kill him outright when
               she came to know that the ox was lost. But just then it came across his mind that
               he
               would go home and take the second ox, and drive it to the town, and not let his
               <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span> know anything about the matter. So he
               did this, and went home and took the ox without his dame’s knowing it, and set off
               with
               it to the town. But <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span> knew all about it,
               and they said to <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>, if he could get this
               ox too, without the man’s knowing it, and without his doing him any harm, he should
               be
               as good as any one of them. If that were all, <span class="The Youth character">the
                  youth</span> said, he did not think it a very hard thing.</p>
            
            <p>This time he took with him a rope, and hung himself up under the arm-pits to a tree
               right
               in the man’s way. So the man came along with his ox, and when he saw such a sight
               hanging there he began to feel a little queer.</p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said he, “whatever heavy thoughts you had who have
               hanged yourself up there, it can’t be helped; you may hang for what I care! I can’t
               breathe life into you again”; and with that he went on his way with his
               ox. Down slipped the youth from the tree, and ran by a footpath, and got before the
               man,
               and hung himself up right in his way again.</p>
            
            <p>“Bless me!” said the man,
               “were you really so heavy at heart
               that you hanged yourself up there—or is it only a piece of witchcraft that I see
               before me? Aye, aye! you may hang for all I care, whether you are a ghost or
               whatever you are.” So he passed on with his ox.</p>
            
            <p>Now <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> did just as he had done twice
               before; he jumped down from the tree, ran through the wood by a footpath, and hung
               himself up right in the man’s way again. But when the man saw this sight for the third
               time, he said to himself:</p>
            
            <p>“Well! this is an ugly business! Is it
               likely now that they should have been so heavy at heart as to hang themselves, all
               these three? No! I cannot think it is anything else than a piece of witchcraft that
               I see. But now I’ll soon know for certain; if the other two are still hanging there,
               it must be really so; but if they are not, then it can be nothing but witchcraft
               that I see.”</p>
            
            <p>So he tied up his ox, and ran back to see if the others were still really hanging
               there.
               But while he went and peered up into all the trees, <span class="The Youth character">the
                  youth</span> jumped down and <span class="actneg">took his ox</span> and ran off with it. When the man came back and
               found his ox gone, he was in a sad plight, and, as any one might know without being
               told, he began to cry and bemoan; but at last he came to take it easier, and so he
               thought:</p>
            
            <p>“There’s no other help for it than to go home
               and take the third ox without my dame’s knowing it, and to try and drive a good
               bargain with it, so that I may get a good sum of money for it.”</p>
            
            <p>So he went home and set off with the ox, and his <span class="Rancher's Wife character">old
                  dame</span> knew never a word about the matter. But <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span>, they knew all about it, and they said to <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>, that if he could steal this ox as he had
               stolen the other two, then he should be master over the whole band. Well, <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> set off, and ran into the wood; and as the man
               came by with his ox he set up a dreadful bellowing, just like a great ox in the wood.
               When the man heard that, you can’t think how glad he was, for it seemed to him that
               he
               knew the voice of his big bullock, and he thought that now he should find both of
               them
               again; so he tied up the third ox, and ran off from the road to look for them in the
               wood; but meantime <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span><span class="actneg"> went off with the third
                  ox</span>. Now, when the man came back and found he had lost this ox too, he was
               so wild that there was no end to his grief. He cried and roared and beat his breast,
               and, to tell the truth, it was many days before he dared go home; for he was afraid
               lest
               his <span class="Rancher's Wife character">old dame</span> should kill him outright on the spot.</p>
            
            <p>As for <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span>, they were not very well pleased
               either, when they had to own that <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> was
               master over the whole band. So one day they thought they would try their hands at
               something which he was not man enough to do; and they set off all together, every
               man
               Jack of them, and left him alone at home. Now, the first thing that he did when they
               were all well clear of the house, was to drive the oxen out to the road, so that they
               might run back to the man from whom he had stolen them; and right glad he was to see
               them, as you may fancy. Next he took all the horses which <span class="Robbers character">the
                  robbers</span> had, and loaded them with the best things he could lay his hands
               on-gold and silver, and clothes and other fine things; and then he bade the <span class="Old Dame character">old dame</span> to greet <span class="Robbers character">the
                  robbers</span> when they came back, and to thank them for him, and to say that
               now he was setting off on his travels, and they would have hard work to find him again;
               and with that, off he started.</p> 
            
            <p>After a good bit he came to the road along which he was
               going when he fell among the robbers, and when he got near home, and could see his
               father’s cottage, he put on a uniform which he had found among the clothes he had
               taken
               from <span class="Robbers character">the robbers</span>, and which was made just like a
               general’s. So he drove up to the door as if he were any other great man. After that
               he
               went in and asked if he could have a lodging? No; that he couldn’t at any price.</p>
            
            <p>“How ever should I be able”, said the man, “to make room in my house for such a fine
               gentleman—I who scarce have a rag to lie upon, and miserable rags too?”</p> 
            
            <p>“You always were a stingy old hunks”, said <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>, “and so you
               are still, when you won’t take your own son in.”</p>
            
            <p>“What, you my son!” said the man.</p> 
            
            <p>“Don’t you know me again?” said <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>. Well,
               after a little while he did know him again.</p>
            
            <p>“But what have you been turning your hand to, that you have made yourself so great
               a man in such haste?” asked the man.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh! I’ll soon tell you”, said <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>. “You said I might
               take to any trade I chose, and so I bound myself apprentice to a pack of thieves and
               robbers, and now I’ve served my time out, and am become a <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>.”</p>
            
            <p>Now there lived a <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> close by to his father’s cottage, and he had such a great house,
               and such heaps of money, he could not tell how much he had. He had a daughter too,
               and a
               smart and pretty girl she was. So the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span> set his heart upon having her to wife, and he told his father to
               go to the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> and ask for his daughter for him.</p>
            
            <p>“If he asks by what trade I get my living, you can say I’m a <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>.”</p>
            
            <p>“I think you’ve lost your wits”, said the man, “for you can’t be in your right mind when you think of such stuff.”</p>
            
            <p>No! he had not lost his wits, his father must and should go to the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, and ask for his daughter.</p>
            
            <p>“Nay, but I tell you, I daren’t go to the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> and be your spokesman; he who is so rich,
               and has so much money”, said the man.</p>
            
            <p>Yes, there was no help for it, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>; he should go whether he would or no;
               and if he did not go by fair means, he would soon make him go by foul. But the man
               was
               still loath to go; so he stepped after him, and rubbed him down with a good birch
               cudgel, and kept on till the man came crying and sobbing inside the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s door.</p>
            
            <p>“How now, my man! what ails you?” said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>. So he told him the whole story; how he
               had three sons who set off one day, and how he had given them leave to go whithersoever
               they would, and to follow whatever calling they chose. “And here now is the youngest
               come home, and has thrashed me till he has made me come to you and ask for your daughter
               for him to wife; and he bids me say, besides, that he’s a Master Thief.” And so he fell
               to crying and sobbing again.</p>
            
            <p>“Never mind, my man”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, laughing; “just go back and tell him from me, he must prove his
               skill first. If he can steal the roast from the spit in the kitchen on Sunday, while
               all
               the household are looking after it, he shall have my daughter. Just go and tell him
               that.”</p>
            
            <p>So he went back and told <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>, who
               thought it would be an easy job. So he set about and caught three hares alive, and
               put
               them into a bag, and dressed himself in some old rags, until he looked so poor and
               filthy that it made one’s heart bleed to see; and then he stole into the passage at
               the
               back-door of the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s house on the Sunday
               forenoon, with his bag, just like any other beggar-boy. But the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> himself and all his household were in the kitchen watching the
               roast. Just as they were doing this, <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>
               let one hare go, and it set off and ran round and round the yard in front of the house.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, just look at that hare!” said the <span class="Kitchen Folk character">folk in the kitchen</span>, and were all for running out
               to catch it.</p> 
            
            <p>Yes, the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> saw it running too.
               “Oh, let it run”, said he; “there’s no use in thinking to catch a hare on the spring.”</p>
            
            <p>A little while after, <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> let the second hare
               go, and they saw it in the kitchen, and thought it was the same they had seen before,
               and still wanted to run out and catch it; but the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> said again it was no use. It was not long before <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> let the third hare go, and it set off and ran
               round and round the yard as the others before it. Now, they saw it from the kitchen,
               and
               still thought it was the same hare that kept on running about, and were all eager
               to be
               out after it.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, it is a fine hare”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>; “come let’s see if we can’t lay our hands on it.”</p>
            
            <p>So out he ran, and the rest with him—away they all went, the hare before, and they
               after; so that
               it was rare fun to see. But meantime <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span>
               took the roast and ran off with it; and where the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> got a roast for his dinner that day I don’t know; but one thing
               I know, and that is, that he had no roast hare, though he ran after it till he was
               both
               warm and weary.</p>
            
            <p>Now it chanced that the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> came to dinner that day, and when the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> told him what a trick the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> had played him, he made such game of him
               that there was no end of it.</p>
            
            <p>“For my part”, said the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>, “I can’t think how it could
               ever happen to me to be made such a fool of by a fellow like that.”</p>
            
            <p>“Very well—only keep a sharp look-out”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>; “maybe he’ll
               come to see you before you know a word of it.” But the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> stuck to his text—that he
               did, and made game of the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> because he had been
               so taken in.</p>
            
            <p>Later in the afternoon came the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span>, and wanted to have the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s daughter, as he had given his word. But the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> began to talk him over, and said, “Oh, you must
               first prove your skill a little more; for what you did to-day was no great thing,
               after
               all. Couldn’t you now play off a good trick on the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>, who is sitting in there, and
               making game of me for letting such a fellow as you twist me round his thumb.”</p>
            
            <p>“Well, as for that, it wouldn’t be hard”, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span>. So he dressed himself up like a bird, threw a great white sheet
               over his body, took the wings of a goose and tied them to his back, and so climbed up
               into a great maple which stood in the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>’s garden. And when the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> came home in
               the evening, <span class="The Youth character">the youth</span> began to bawl out:</p>
            
            <p>“Father Laurence! Father Laurence!”—for that was the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>’s name.</p>
            
            <p>“Who is that calling me?” said the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“I am an angel”, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>, “sent from God to let you know
               that you shall be taken up alive into heaven for your piety’s sake. Next Monday night
               you must hold yourself ready for the journey, for I shall come then to fetch you in
               a
               sack; and all your gold and your silver, and all that you have of this world’s goods,
               you must lay together in a heap in your dining-room.”</p>
            
            <p>Well, <span class="Priest character">Father Laurence</span> fell on his knees before the angel, and thanked him; and the very next day he preached
               a farewell
               sermon, and gave it out how there had come down an angel unto the big maple in his
               garden, who had told him that he was to be taken up alive into heaven for his piety’s
               sake; and he preached and made such a touching discourse, that all who were at church
               wept, both young and old.</p>
            
            <p>So the next Monday night came the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> like an angel again, and the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> fell
               on his knees and thanked him before he was put into the sack; but when he had got
               him
               well in, the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> <span class="actneg">drew and dragged him over stocks and stones.</span></p>
            
            <p>“OW! OW!” groaned the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> inside the sack, “wherever are we going?”</p>
            
            <p>“This is the narrow way which leadeth unto the kingdom of heaven”, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span>, who went on dragging him along till he had nearly broken every
               bone in his body. At last he tumbled him into a goose-house that belonged to the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, and the geese began pecking and pinching
               him with their bills, so that he was more dead than alive.</p>
            
            <p>“Now you are in the flames of purgatory, to be cleansed and purified for life everlasting”, said the Master Thief; and
               with that he went his way, and took all the gold which the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> had laid together in
               his dining-room. The next morning, when the <span class="Goose Girl character">goose-girl</span> came to let the geese out, she
               heard how the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> lay in the sack, and bemoaned himself in the goose-house.</p>
            
            <p>“In heaven’s name, who’s there, and what ails you?” she cried.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh!” said the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>, “if you are an angel from heaven, do let me out, and let me return again to earth,
               for it is
               worse here than in hell. The little fiends keep on pinching me with tongs.”</p>
            
            <p>“Heaven help us, I am no angel at all”, said the <span class="Goose Girl character">girl</span>, as she helped the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span> out of the sack; “I
               only look after the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s geese, and like enough
               they are the little fiends which have pinched your reverence."</p>
            
            <p>“Oh!” groaned the <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>, “this is all that <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>’s doing. Ah! my
               gold and my silver, and my fine clothes.” And he beat his breast, and hobbled home at
               such a rate that the girl thought he had lost his wits all at once.</p>
            
            <p>Now when the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> came to hear how it had gone with the
               <span class="Priest character">Priest</span>, and how he had been along the narrow way, and into purgatory, he laughed till he
               well-nigh split his sides. But when the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span> came and asked for his daughter as he had promised, the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> put him off again, and said:</p>
            
            <p>“You must do one masterpiece better still, that I may see plainly what you are fit
               for. Now, I have
               twelve horses in my stable, and on them I will put twelve grooms, one on each. If
               you
               are so good a thief as to steal the horses from under them, I’ll see what I can do
               for
               you.”</p>
            
            <p>“Very well, I daresay I can do it”, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span>; “but shall I really have your daughter if I can?”</p>
            
            <p>“Yes, if you can, I’ll do my best for you”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>. So
               the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> set off to a shop, and bought
               brandy enough to fill two pocket-flasks, and into one of them he put a sleepy drink,
               but
               into the other only brandy. After that he hired eleven men to lie in wait at night,
               behind the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s stable-yard; and last of all,
               for fair words and a good bit of money, he borrowed a ragged gown and cloak from an
               old
               woman; and so, with a staff in his hand, and a bundle at his back, he limped off,
               as
               evening drew on, towards the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s stable. Just
               as he got there they were watering the horses for the night, and had their hands full
               of
               work. “What the devil do you want?” said one of the grooms to the old woman.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh, oh! hutetu! it is so bitter cold”, said she, and shivered and shook, and made
               wry faces.
               “Hutetu! it is so cold, a poor wretch may easily freeze to death”; and with that she
               fell to shivering and shaking again.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh! for the love of heaven, can I get leave to
               stay here a while, and sit inside the stable door?”</p>
            
            <p>“To the devil with your leave”, said one. “Pack yourself off this minute, for if the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> sets his eye on you, he’ll lead us a pretty dance.”</p>
            
            <p>“Oh! the poor old bag-of-bones”, said another, whose heart took pity on her, “the
               old hag may sit
               inside and welcome; such a one as she can do no harm.”</p>
            
            <p>And the rest said, some she should stay, and some she shouldn’t; but while they were
               quarrelling and minding the
               horses, she crept further and further into the stable, till at last she sat herself
               down
               behind the door; and when she had got so far, no one gave any more heed to her.</p>
            
            <p>As the night wore on, the men found it rather cold work to sit so still and quiet
               on horseback.</p>
            
            <p>“Hutetu! it is so devilish cold”, said one, and beat his arms crosswise.</p>
            
            <p>“That it is”, said another; “I freeze so, that my teeth chatter.”</p>
            
            <p>“If one only had a quid to chew”, said a third.</p>
            
            <p>Well! there was one who had an ounce or two; so they shared it between
               them, though it wasn’t much, after all, that each got; and so they chewed and spat,
               and
               spat and chewed. This helped them somewhat; but in a little while they were just as
               bad
               as ever.</p>
            
            <p>“Hutetu!” said one, and shivered and shook.</p>
            
            <p>“Hutetu!” said the old woman, and shivered so, that every tooth in her head chattered.
               Then she pulled out the flask with
               brandy in it, and her hand shook so that the spirit splashed about in the flask, and
               then she took such a gulp, that it went “bop” in her throat.</p>
            
            <p>“What’s that you’ve got in your flask, old girl?” said one of the grooms.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh! it’s only a drop of brandy, old man”, said she.</p>
            
            <p>“Brandy! Well, I never! Do let me have a drop”, screamed the whole twelve, one after
               another.</p> 
            
            <p>“Oh! but it is such a little drop”, mumbled the old woman,
               “it will not even wet your mouths round.” But they must and would have it; there was
               no
               help for it; and so she pulled out the flask with the sleepy drink in it, and put
               it to
               the first man’s lips; then she shook no more, but guided the flask so that each of
               them
               got what he wanted, and the twelfth had not done drinking before the first sat and
               snored. Then the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> threw off his
               beggar’s rags, and took one groom after the other so softly off their horses, and
               set
               them astride on the beams between the stalls; and so he called his eleven men, and
               rode
               off with the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s twelve horses. But when the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> got up in the morning, and went to look
               after his grooms, they had just begun to come to; and some of them fell to spurring
               the
               beams with their spurs, till the splinters flew again, and some fell off, and some
               still
               hung on and sat there looking like fools.</p>
            
            <p>“Ho! ho!” said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>; “I see very well who has been here; but as for you, a pretty
               set of blockheads you must be to sit here and let the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> steal the horses from between your legs.”</p>
            
            <p>So they all got a good leathering because they had not kept a sharper look-out.</p>
            
            <p>Further on in the day came the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> again, and told how he
               had managed the matter, and asked for the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s
               daughter, as he had promised; but the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> gave
               him one hundred dollars down, and said he must do something better still.</p>
            
            <p>“Do you think now”, said he, “you can steal the horse from under me while I am out
               riding on his
               back?” “O, yes! I daresay I could”, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span>, “if I were really sure of getting your daughter.”</p>
            
            <p>Well, well, the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> would see what he could do; and he told
               the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> a day when he would be taking
               a ride on a great common where they drilled the troops. So the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> soon got hold of an old worn-out jade of
               a mare, and set to work, and made traces and collar of withies and broom-twigs, and
               bought an old beggarly cart and a great cask. After that he told an old beggar woman,
               he
               would give her ten dollars if she would get inside the cask, and keep her mouth agape
               over the taphole, into which he was going to stick his finger. No harm should happen
               to
               her; she should only be driven about a little; and if he took his finger out more
               than
               once, she was to have ten dollars more. Then he threw a few rags and tatters over
               himself, and stuffed himself out, and put on a wig and a great beard of goat’s hair,
               so
               that no one could know him again, and set off for the common, where the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> had already been riding about a good bit. When he
               reached the place, he went along so softly and slowly that he scarce made an inch
               of
               way. “Gee up! Gee up!” and so he went on a little; then he stood stock still, and
               so on
               a little again; and altogether the pace was so poor it never once came into the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s head that this could be the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>.</p>
            
            <p>At last the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> rode right up to him, and asked if he had seen any one lurking
               about in the wood thereabouts. “No”, said the man, “I haven’t seen a soul.”</p>
            
            <p>“Harkye, now”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, “if you have a mind to ride
               into the wood, and hunt about and see if you can fall upon any one lurking about there,
               you shall have the loan of my horse, and a shilling into the bargain, to drink my
               health, for your pains.”</p>
            
            <p>“I don’t see how I can go”, said the man, “for I am going to a
               wedding with this cask of mead, which I have been to town to fetch, and here the tap
               has
               fallen out by the way, and so I must go along, holding my finger in the taphole.”</p>
            
            <p>“Ride off”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>; “I’ll look after your horse
               and cask.”</p>
            
            <p>Well, on these terms the man was willing to go; but he begged the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> to be quick in putting his finger into the taphole
               when he took his own out, and to mind and keep it there till he came back. At last
               the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> grew weary of standing there with his
               finger in the taphole, so he took it out.</p>
            
            <p>“Now I shall have ten dollars more!” screamed
               the old woman inside the cask; and then the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>
               saw at once how the land lay, and took himself off home; but he had not gone far before
               they met him with a fresh horse, for the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span> had already been to his house, and told them to send one. The day
               after, he came to the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> and would have his
               daughter, as he had given his word; but the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>
               put him off again with fine words, and gave him two hundred dollars, and said he must
               do
               one more masterpiece. If he could do that, he should have her. Well, well, the
               <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> thought he could do it, if he
               only knew what it was to be.</p>
            
            <p>“Do you think, now”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, “you can steal the sheet off our bed, and the shift off my
               wife’s back. Do you think you could do that?”</p>
            
            <p>“It shall be done”, said the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span>. “I only wish I was as sure of getting
               your daughter.”</p>
            
            <p>So when night began to fall, the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span> went out and cut down a thief who hung on the gallows, and threw
               him across his shoulders, and carried him off. Then he got a long ladder and set it
               up
               against the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s bedroom window, and so climbed
               up, and kept bobbing the dead man up and down, just for all the world like one that
               was
               peeping in at the window.</p>
            
            <p>“That’s the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span>, old lass!” said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>,
               and gave his wife a nudge on the side. “Now see if I don’t shoot him, that’s all.”</p>
            
            <p>So saying he took up a rifle which he had laid at his bedside.</p>
            
            <p>“No! no! pray don’t shoot him after telling him he might come and try”, said his wife.</p>
            
            <p>“Don’t talk to me, for shoot him I will”, said he; and so he lay there and aimed and
               aimed; but as soon as the
               head came up before the window, and he saw a little of it, so soon was it down again.
               At
               last he thought he had a good aim; “bang” went the gun, down fell the dead body to
               the
               ground with a heavy thump, and down went the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span> too as fast as he could.</p>
            
            <p>“Well”, said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, “it is quite true that I am the chief magistrate in these
               parts; but people are fond of talking, and it would be a bore if they came to see
               this
               dead man’s body. I think the best thing to be done is that I should go down and bury
               him.”</p>
            
            <p>“You must do as you think best, dear”, said his wife. So the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> got out of bed and went downstairs, and he had
               scarce put his foot out of the door before the <span class="Master Thief character">Master
                  Thief</span> stole in, and went straight upstairs to his wife.</p>
            
            <p>“Why, dear, back already!” said she, for she thought it was her husband.</p>
            
            <p>“O yes, I only just put him into a hole, and threw a little earth over him. It is
               enough that he is out of sight, for it
               is such a bad night out of doors; by-and-by I’ll do it better. But just let me have
               the
               sheet to wipe myself with—he was so bloody—and I have made myself in such a mess with
               him.”</p>
            
            <p>So he got the sheet.</p>
            
            <p>After a while he said:</p>
            
            <p>“Do you know I am afraid you must let
               me have your nightshift too, for the sheet won’t do by itself; that I can see.”</p>
            
            <p>So she gave him the shift also. But just then it came across his mind that he had
               forgotten to
               lock the house-door, so he must step down and look to that before he came back to
               bed,
               and away he went with both shift and sheet.</p>
            
            <p>A little while after came the true <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Why! what a time you’ve taken to lock
               the door, dear!” said his wife; “and what have you done with the sheet and shift?”</p>
            
            <p>“What do you say?” said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>.</p>
            
            <p>“Why, I am asking what you have done with the sheet and shift that you had to wipe
               off the blood”, said she.</p>
            
            <p>“What, in the Deil’s name!” said the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>, “has he
               taken me in this time too?”</p>
            
            <p>Next day came the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> and asked for the <span class="Squire character">Squire</span>’s daughter, as he had given his word; and then the
               <span class="Squire character">Squire</span> dared not do anything else than give her
               to him, and a good lump of money into the bargain; for, to tell the truth, he was
               afraid
               lest the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> should steal the eyes
               out of his head, and that the people would begin to say spiteful things of him if
               he
               broke his word. So the <span class="Master Thief character">Master Thief</span> lived well and happily from that time forward. I
               don’t know whether he stole any more; but if he did, I am quite sure it was only for
               the
               sake of a bit of fun.</p>

         <h2>WHY THE SEA IS SALT</h2>
         <article>
            
            <p>Once on a time, but it was a long, long time ago, there were two brothers, one
               <span class="descpos">rich</span> and one <span class="descneg">poor</span>. Now, one Christmas eve, the poor one hadn’t so
               much as a crumb in the house, either of meat or bread, so he went to his brother to
               ask
               him for something to keep Christmas with, in God’s name. It was not the first time
               his
               brother had been forced to help him, and you may fancy he wasn’t very glad to see
               his
               face, but he said:</p>
            
            <p>“If you will do what I ask you to
               do, I’ll give you a whole flitch of bacon.” So the <span class="Poor Brother character">poor brother</span> said he would do anything, and was full
               of thanks.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, here is the
               flitch”, said the <span class="Rich Brother character">rich brother</span>,
               “and now go straight to Hell.”</p>
            
            <p>“What I have given my word to do,
               I must stick to”, said the other; so he took the flitch and set off. He
               walked the whole day, and at dusk he came to a place where he saw a very bright
               light.</p>
            
            <p>“Maybe this is the place”,
               said the man to himself. So he turned aside, and the first thing he saw was an old,
               <span class="Old Man character">old man</span>, with a long white beard, who stood in
               an outhouse, hewing wood for the Christmas fire. </p>
            
            <p>
               “Good even”, said the man
               with the flitch.</p>
            
            <p>“The same to you; whither are you
               going so late?” said the man.</p>
            
            <p>
               “Oh! I’m going to Hell, if I only
               knew the right way”, answered the poor man.</p>
            
            <p>“Well, you’re not far wrong, for this
               is Hell”, said the old man; “when you get inside they will be all for buying your flitch, for
               meat is scarce in Hell; but mind, you don’t sell it unless you get the hand-quern
               which stands behind the door for it. When you come out, I’ll <span class="actneu"> teach</span> you how to handle the
               quern, for it’s good to grind almost anything.”</p>
            
            <p>So the man with the flitch <span class="actpos">thanked</span> the other for his good advice, and gave a great knock at the
               <span class="Devil character">Devil</span>’s door.</p>
            
            <p> When he got in, everything went just as the old man had said. All the devils, great
               and
               small, came swarming up to him like ants round an anthill, and each tried to outbid
               the
               other for the flitch. </p>
            
            <p>“Well!” said the man,
                "by rights my old dame and I ought
               to have this flitch for our Christmas dinner; but since you have all set your hearts
               on it, I suppose I must give it up to you; but if I sell it at all, I’ll have for
               it
               that quern behind the door yonder.”</p>
            
            <p>At first the <span class="Devil character">Devil</span> wouldn’t hear of such a bargain,
               and <span class="actneu">chaffered and
                  haggled</span> with the man; but he stuck to what he said, and at last the
               <span class="Devil character">Devil</span> had to part with his quern. When the man
               got out into the yard, he asked the old woodcutter how he was to handle the quern;
               and
               after he had learned how to use it, he <span class="actpos">thanked</span> the old man and went off home as fast as he could,
               but still the clock had struck twelve on Christmas eve before he reached his own
               door.</p>
            
            <p>“Wherever in the world
               have you been?” said his <span class="Poor Brother's Wife character">old
                  dame</span>, “here have I sat hour after hour <span class="actpos">waiting</span> and watching, without so
               much as two sticks to lay together under the Christmas brose.”</p>
            
            <p>
               “Oh!” said the
               man, “I couldn’t get back
               before, for I had to go a long way first for one thing, and then for another; but
               now you shall see what you shall see.”</p>
            
            <p>So he put the quern on the table, and bade it first of all grind lights, then a
               table-cloth, then meat, then ale, and so on till they had got everything that was
               nice
               for Christmas fare. He had only to speak the word, and the quern ground out what he
               wanted. The old dame stood by blessing her stars, and kept on asking where he had
               got
               this wonderful quern, but he wouldn’t tell her.</p>
            
            <p>“It’s all one where I got
               it from; you see the quern is a good one, and the mill-stream never freezes, that’s
               enough.”</p>
            
            <p>So he ground meat and drink and dainties enough to last out till Twelfth Day, and
               on the
               third day he asked all his friends and kin to his house, and gave a great feast. Now,
               when his <span class="Rich Brother character">rich brother</span> saw all that was on the
               table, and all that was behind in the larder, he grew quite <span class="descneg">spiteful and
                  wild</span>, for he <span class="actneg">couldn’t bear that his brother should have anything.</span></p>
            
            <p>“’Twas only on Christmas
               eve”, he said to the rest, “he was <span class="descneg">in such straits</span>, that he came and asked for a morsel of food in
               God’s name, and now he gives a feast <span class="descneg">as if he were count or
                  king</span>”; and he turned to his brother and said:</p>
            
            <p>“But whence, in Hell’s name, have
               you got all this wealth?”</p>
            
            <p>“From behind the
               door”, answered the <span class="Poor Brother character">owner of the
                  quern</span>, for he didn’t care to let the cat out of the bag.
               But later on the evening, when he had got a drop too much, he could keep his secret
               no
               longer, and brought out the quern and said:</p>
            
            <p>“There, you see what has gotten me all
               this wealth”; and so he made the quern grind all kind of things. When his
               <span class="Rich Brother character">brother</span> saw it, he set his heart on having
               the quern, and, after a deal of <span class="actneu">coaxing</span>, he got it; but he had to pay three hundred dollars
               for it, and <span class="Poor Brother character">his brother</span> bargained to keep it
               till hay-harvest, for he thought, if I keep it till then, I can make it grind meat
               and
               drink that will last for years. So you may fancy the quern didn’t grow rusty for want
               of
               work, and when hay-harvest came, the <span class="Rich Brother character">rich
                  brother</span> got it, but <span class="Poor Brother character">the other</span>
               took care <span class="actneg">not to
                  teach</span> him how to handle it. </p>
            
            <p>It was evening when the <span class="Rich Brother character">rich brother</span> got the
               quern home, and next morning he told his wife to go out into the hay-field and toss,
               while the mowers cut the grass, and he would stay at home and get the dinner ready.
               So,
               when dinner-time drew near, he put the quern on the kitchen table and said:</p>
            
            <p>“Grind herrings and broth, and grind them
               good and fast.”</p>
            
            <p>So the quern began to grind herrings and broth; first of all, all the dishes full,
               then
               all the tubs full, and so on till the kitchen floor was quite covered. Then the man
               <span class="actneg">twisted and
                  twirled</span> at the quern to get it to stop, but for all his twisting and
               fingering the quern went on grinding, and in a little while the broth rose so high
               that
               <span class="Rich Brother character">the man</span> was like to drown. So he threw
               open the kitchen door and ran into the parlour, but it wasn’t long before the quern
               had
               ground the parlour full too, and it was only at the risk of his life that the man
               could
               get hold of the latch of the house door through the stream of broth. When he got the
               door open, he ran out and set off down the road, with the stream of herrings and broth
               at his heels, roaring like a waterfall over the whole farm. Now, <span class="Rich Brother's Wife character">his old dame</span>, who was in the field tossing
               hay, thought it a long time to dinner, and at last she said:</p>
            
            <p>“Well! though <span class="Rich Brother character">the master</span> doesn’t call us home, we may as well
               go. Maybe he finds it hard work to boil the broth, and will be glad of my
               help.”</p>
            
            <p>The men were willing enough, so they sauntered homewards; but just as they had got
               a
               little way up the hill, what should they meet but herrings, and broth, and bread,
               all
               running and dashing, and splashing together in a stream, and the master himself <span class="actneg">running before them for his
                  life</span>, and as he passed them he bawled out:</p>
            
            <p>“Would to heaven each of you had
               a hundred throats! but take care you’re not drowned in the broth.”</p>
            
            <p>Away he went, as though the <span class="Devil character">Evil One</span> were at his
               heels, to <span class="Poor Brother character">his brother</span>’s house, and begged him
               for God’s sake to take back the quern that instant; for, said he:</p>
            
            <p>“If it grinds only one hour more,
               the whole parish will be swallowed up by herrings and broth.”
               </p>
            
            <p>But <span class="Poor Brother character">his brother</span>
               <span class="actneg">wouldn’t hear of
                  taking it back</span> till the other paid him down three hundred dollars more.</p>
            
            <p>So the<span class="Poor Brother character">poor brother</span> got both the money and the
               quern, and it wasn’t long before he <span class="actneg">set up a farm-house far finer than the one in which his brother
                  lived</span>, and with the quern he ground so much gold that he covered it with
               plates of gold; and as the farm lay by the sea-side, the golden house gleamed and
               glistened far away over the sea. All who sailed by put ashore to see the <span class="Poor Brother character">rich man</span> in the golden house, and to see the
               wonderful quern, the fame of which spread far and wide, till there was nobody who
               hadn’t
               heard tell of it.</p>
            
            <p>So one day there came a <span class="Skipper character">skipper</span> who wanted to see
               the quern; and the first thing he <span class="actneu">asked</span> was if it could grind salt.</p>
            
            <p>“Grind salt!” said
               <span class="Poor Brother character">the owner</span>; “I should just think it could. It can grind
               anything.” When the <span class="Skipper character">skipper</span> heard
               that, he said he must have the quern, cost what it would; for if he only had it, he
               thought he should be rid of his long voyages across stormy seas for a lading of salt.
               Well, at first <span class="Poor Brother character">the man</span> wouldn’t hear of
               parting with the quern; but the <span class="Skipper character">skipper</span>
               <span class="actneu">begged and prayed</span>
               so hard, that at last he let him have it, but he had to pay many, many thousand dollars
               for it. Now, when the <span class="Skipper character">skipper</span> had got the quern on
               his back, he soon made off with it, for he was <span class="actneg">afraid lest the man should change his
                  mind</span>; so he had no time to ask how to handle the quern, but got on board
               his ship as fast as he could, and set sail. When he had sailed a good way off, he
               brought the quern on deck and said:</p>
            
            <p>“Grind salt, and grind both good and
               fast.”</p>
            
            <p>Well, the quern began to grind salt so that it poured out like water; and when the
               <span class="Skipper character">skipper</span> had got the ship full, he wished to
               stop the quern, but whichever way he turned it, and however much he tried, it was
               no
               good; the quern kept grinding on, and the heap of salt grew higher and higher, and
               at
               last down sank the ship. </p>
            
            <p>There lies the quern at the bottom of the sea, and grinds away at this very day, and
               that’s why the sea is salt.</p>
