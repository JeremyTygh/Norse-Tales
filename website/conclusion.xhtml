                <h2>Throughout the Norse Tales how do characters' actions/traits influence the
                    reader's perception of them in their stories?</h2>
                <p>In Norse Tales, typically the main character is classified as a hero because they
                    always help others and perform stoic actions, which we classify as positive
                    traits. In terms of our data, we counted these actions as positive traits. We
                    can distinguish who the hero of our tale is based on our graphs because those
                    characters have a large amount of positive traits. Typically, the hero character
                    is also perceived in a positive manner. Our villainous characters are typically
                    distinguished by negative traits both in their actions and how they are
                    perceived. This is illustrated by our graphs, as typically the villains will have
                    the most number of negative qualities. Intermediate characters vary, in the
                    sense that they can be both positive and negative, although not to the same
                    scale as the main characters.</p>

                <h3>How do different species' actions/traits differ from each other?</h3>
                <p>For this question we did not collect enough substantial data to come to a
                    conclusion for all species mentioned in the tales corpus. However, we can
                    conclude with confidence that some species in the works show solid patterns of
                    positivity or negativity. For example, Trolls and Giants are portrayed as the
                    enemies of humans in practically all tales. This is illustrated in our graphs
                    indicated by the negative corresponding data. Similar to real life, humans are
                    categorized as overwhelmingly positive or negative, depending on the
                    character.</p>

                <h3>How does transformation influence a character throughout their tale? Is the
                    reader's perception of them altered post transformation?</h3>
                <p>In our chosen tales, there were only a small amount of transformations. However,
                    in <i>East O’ the Sun and West O’ the Moon</i>, the Prince is able to transform into
                    the White Bear. Based off of our data, the White Bear is not looked at as
                    positively as his alternate form, the Prince. In <i>The Master Thief</i>, the thief
                    changes his form into a goose, and then an angel. In both of these cases, his
                    transformation is for mischievous purposes, which we correlate with a negative
                    character perception. Transformations are not the deciding factor when
                    determining character perceptions in our tales. Instead, perceptions are more
                    based on the characters’ actions in a given form.</p>

                <h3>Does the positivity/negativity of a character's actions/traits correlate
                    directly to the character's overall positivity/negativity</h3>
                <p>While mainly applicable to the main heroes and villains of a given tale, the
                    actions of a character do have a large implication on their overall perception
                    of positivity/negativity. This is made clear, as in our data, correlations found
                    in our action graphs are also present in our descriptor graphs. For example, in
                    <i>East O’ the Sun and West O’ the Moon</i>, the Prince’s actions are all viewed
                    positively. In the descriptor graph, the narrator describes the Prince in an
                    overwhelmingly positive manner. This same trend can be found throughout many of
                    the tales, but not all (like in <i>Tatterhood</i> where she performs positive actions.
                    However, she is perceived negatively in the descriptor graph due to being viewed
                    as “ugly”), when examining the main characters.</p>

                <h3>How are character interactions represented in terms of positivity and negativity
                    in their descriptions?</h3>
                <p>Although there is some variance in characters’ different perceptions of each
                    other in our “Relationships in Character Descriptors” graph, typically, a
                    majority of speakers view the same subject in the same light. For example, in
                    <i>The Giant Who Had No Heart In His Body</i>, both the wolf and princess view the
                    Giant negatively. However, the narrator does speak of the Giant positively in
                    one instance. Despite this, it is clear that generally, the Giant is described
                    negatively. This pattern can be found in a majority of the tales. </p>
