        <title>THE FOX AS HERDSMAN</title>
        <body>
            <p>Once on a time there was a <character who="woman">woman</character> who went out to hire
                a herdsman, and she met a <character who="bear">bear</character>.</p>
            <p><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear">“Whither away, Goody?” said <character

            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Oh, I’m going out to hire a herdsman”,
                answered the <character who="woman">woman</character>.</dialogue>

            <p><dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="bear"

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“Well, why not?” said the <character

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="bear" subject="woman">“OW, OW!” growled the <character who="bear">bear</character>.</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="bear">“No, no! I won’t have you”, said the <character who="woman">woman</character>,</dialogue> as
                soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.
            </p>
            <p>So, when she had gone a bit further, she met a <character who="wolf">wolf</character>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Oh!” said she, “I’m going out to hire a

            <p><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="wolf"

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“Well, why not? if you can only call the flock;
                let me hear?” said she.</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="wolf" subject="woman">“UH, UH!” said the <character who="wolf">Wolf</character>.</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="wolf">“No, no!” said the <character who="woman">woman</character>; “you’ll never do for
                me.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a <character who="fox">fox</character>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"
                >“Whither away, Goody?” asked the <character who="fox">Fox</character>.</fig_lang></dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Oh, I’m just going out to hire a herdsman”, said
                the <character who="woman">woman</character>.</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="fox"
                >“Why not have me for your herdsman?” asked the <character who="fox">Fox</character>.</fig_lang></dialogue>

            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Well, why not?” said she; “if you only knew how
                to call the flock; let me hear?”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman">“DIL-DAL-HOLOM”, sung out the <character who="fox">Fox</character>, in such a fine
                clear voice.</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="woman" subject="fox">“Yes; I’ll have you for my herdsman”, said the
                woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.</dialogue></p>
            <p>The first day the <character who="fox">Fox</character> was herdsman he <action actor="fox" subject="woman" sign="negative"
                >ate up all the woman’s goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the
                third day he ate up all her kine.</action> So, when he came home at even, the woman
                asked what he had done with all her flocks?</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="fox" subject="woman"><fig_lang type="pesonification" subject="fox"
                >“Oh!” said the <character who="fox">Fox</character>, “their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the
                holt.”</fig_lang></dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <character who="woman">the Goody</character> stood and churned when the fox said this, but she thought she might as
                well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away <action actor="fox"
                    subject="cream" sign="negative">the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the
                    cream.</action> So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage,
                that <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="fox" sign="negative"><action
                    actor="woman" subject="fox" sign="positive">she snatched up the little morsel of
                    the cream that was left, and threw it at the fox as he ran off,</action> so that
                    he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that’s the reason why the fox has a
                    white tip to his brush.</descriptor></p>

    <title>THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY</title>
    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was a <character who="King">king</character>
            <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="King" sign="neutral">who had seven sons, and he
                loved them so much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one
                must always be with him.</descriptor> Now, when they were grown up, <character
                who="Princes">six</character> were to set off to woo, but as for the <descriptor
                speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots" sign="neutral">youngest</descriptor>, his father
            kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the palace.
                <action actor="King" subject="princes" sign="positive">So the king gave the six the
                finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that the light gleamed from them a long
                way off, and each had his horse, which cost many, many hundred dollars, and so they
                set off.</action><descriptor subject="princes" sign="neutral" speaker="Narrator">
                Now, when they had been to many palaces, and seen many princesses, at last they came
                to a king who had <character who="princesses">six daughters</character>; such lovely
                king’s daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and
                when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again</descriptor>,
                <action subject="Boots" sign="negative" actor="princes">but they quite forgot that
                they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for <character who="Boots"
                    >Boots</character>, their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head
                and ears in love with their own sweethearts.</action></p>
        <p>But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side,
            like a wall, where the giant’s house was, and there the <character who="Giant"
                >giant</character> came out, and set his eyes upon them, and <action actor="Giant"
                subject="princes and princesses" sign="negative">turned them all into stone, princes
                and princesses and all.</action>
            <descriptor subject="King" sign="negative" speaker="Narrator">Now the king waited and
                waited for his six sons, but the more he waited, the longer they stayed away; so he
                fell into great trouble, and said he should never know what it was to be glad
                again.</descriptor></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“And if I had not you left”, he said to
                    <character who="Boots">Boots</character>, “I would live no longer, so full of
                sorrow am I for the loss of your brothers.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="King">“Well, but now I’ve been thinking to ask your
                leave to set out and find them again; that’s what I’m thinking of”, said <character

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“Nay, nay!” said his father; “that leave you
                shall never get, for then you would stay away too.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p>But <character who="Boots">Boots</character> had set his heart upon it; go he would; and
            he begged and prayed so long that the <character who="King">king</character> was forced
            to let him go. <descriptor subject="King" sign="negative" speaker="Narrator">Now, you
                must know the king had no other horse to give <character who="Boots"
                    >Boots</character> but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their
                train had carried off all his horses;</descriptor> but <character who="Boots"
                >Boots</character> did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his
            sorry-old-steed.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="King">“Farewell, father”, said he; “I’ll come back,
                never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me”; and with
                that he rode off.</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p>So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a <character who="Raven">Raven</character>,
                <descriptor subject="Raven" sign="neutral" speaker="Narrator">which lay in the road
                and flapped its wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so
                starved.</descriptor></p>
        <p><fig_lang type="personification" subject="Raven">“Oh, dear friend”, said the <character
                    who="Raven">Raven</character>, “give me a little food, and I’ll help you again
                at your utmost need.”</fig_lang>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Raven">“I haven’t much food”, said the <character
                    who="Boots">Prince</character>, “and I don’t see how you’ll ever be able to help
                me much; but still I can spare you a little. I see you want it.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><action actor="Boots" subject="Raven" sign="positive">So he gave the <character

        </p>
        <p>Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a
                <character who="Salmon">great Salmon</character>, <descriptor subject="Salmon"
                sign="neutral" speaker="Narrator">which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself

        <p><dialogue speaker="Salmon" subject="Boots"><fig_lang type="personification"
                    subject="Salmon">“Oh, dear friend”, said the <character who="Salmon"
                        >Salmon</character> to the <character who="Boots">Prince</character>; “shove
                    me out into the water again, and I’ll help you again at your utmost

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Salmon">“Well!” said the <character who="Boots"
                    >Prince</character>, “the help you’ll give me will not be great, I daresay, but
                it’s a pity you should lie there and choke”</dialogue>; and with that <action
                actor="Boots" subject="Salmon" sign="positive">he shot the fish out into the stream
                again.</action></p>
        <p>After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a <character who="Wolf"
                >Wolf</character>, which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on
            its belly.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots"><fig_lang type="personification" subject="Wolf"
                    >“Dear friend, do let me have your horse”, said the <character who="Wolf"

                    had nothing to eat these two years.”</fig_lang></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Wolf">“No”, said <character who="Boots"
                    >Boots</character>, “this will never do; “first I came to a <character
                    who="Raven">raven</character>, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came
                to a <character who="Salmon">salmon</character>, and him I had to help into the
                water again; and now you will have my horse. It can’t be done, that it can’t, for
                then I should have nothing to ride on.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Nay, dear friend, but you can help me”, said
                    <character who="Wolf">Graylegs the wolf</character>; “you can ride upon my back,
                and I’ll help you again in your utmost need.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Well! the help I shall get from you will not
                be great, I’ll be bound”, said the <character who="Boots">Prince</character>; “but
                you may take my horse, since you are in such need.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><action actor="Wolf" subject="Boots" sign="positive">So when the <character who="Wolf"
                    >wolf</character> had eaten the horse, <character who="Boots">Boots</character>
                took the bit and put it into the wolf’s jaw, and laid the saddle on his back;
                    <descriptor subject="Wolf" sign="positive" speaker="Narrator">and now the
                        <character who="Wolf">wolf</character> was so strong, after what he had got
                    inside, that he set off with the <character who="Boots">Prince</character> like
                    nothing. So fast he had never ridden before.</descriptor></action>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“When we have gone a bit farther”, <character

        </p>
        <p>So after a while they came to it.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots"><descriptor subject="Giant"

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Wolf">“Nay, but I daren’t go in”, said the <character

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“No! no!” said the <character who="Wolf"

        </p>
        <p>Well! <character who="Boots">Boots</character> went in, but, truth to say, he was very
            much afraid. When he came in the <character who="Giant">Giant</character> was away, but
            in one of the rooms sat the <character who="Princess">Princess</character>, just as the
                <character who="Wolf">wolf</character> had said, <descriptor speaker="Boots"
                subject="Princess" sign="positive">and so lovely a princess <character who="Boots"

        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“Oh! heaven help you! whence have you
                come?” said the <character who="Princess">Princess</character>, as she saw him; “it
                will surely be your death. <descriptor subject="Giant" sign="negative" speaker="Princess">
                    No one can make an end of the Giant who lives here, for
                he has no heart in his body.”</descriptor></dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Princess">“Well! well!” said <character who="Boots"
                    >Boots</character>; “but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do
                with him; and I will see if I can’t free my brothers, who are standing turned to
                stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“Well, if you must, you must”, said the

                hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I
                talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><action actor="Boots" subject="bed" sign="neutral">So he crept under the bed, and he had

        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“Ha!” roared the <character who="Giant"

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Yes, I know there is”, said the <character

                out, but all one can do, the smell doesn’t go off so soon.”</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p>So the <character who="Giant">Giant</character> said no more about it, and when night
            came, they went to bed. After they had lain awhile, the <character who="Princess"

        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“There is one thing I’d be so glad to ask

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“What thing is that?” asked the <character

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Only where it is you keep your heart,

        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“Well”, said the <character who="Princess"

        <p>Then back came the <character who="Giant">Giant</character>.</p>
        <p>Snuff-snuff! <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“My eyes and limbs, what a

        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“I know there is”, said the <character

        </p>
        <p>When the <character who="Giant">Giant</character> heard that, he said no more about it;

        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all this

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“How can you be so silly as to believe any

        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“You’re a goose”, said the <character

        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Well”, said the <character who="Princess"

        </p>
        <p>Then the poor <character who="Giant">Giant</character> could hold out no longer, but was
            forced to say:</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on

        <p>In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the <character who="Giant"

                told him all that had happened inside the house, and said now he wished to ride to

                they went, till the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and

                the <character who="Wolf">Wolf</character> bade him only not be afraid, but stick

        <p>Wherever she went in all her realm she found God’s blessing in children, even in the

        <p>So one day the <character who="adopted daughter">little lassie</character> whom they had

        <p><dialogue speaker="old beggar wife" subject="Queen">“One way to help you perhaps I

    <title>THE MASTER THIEF</title>
    <body>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a <character who="Cottager">poor cottager</character> who had
            three sons. He had nothing to leave them when he died, and no money with which to put
            them to any trade, so that he did not know what to make of them. At last he said he
            would give them leave to take to anything each liked best, and to go whithersoever they
            pleased, and he would go with them a bit of the way; and so he did. He went with them
            till they came to a place where three roads met, and there each of them chose a road,
            and their father bade them good-bye, and went back home. I have never heard tell what
            became of the two elder; but as for <character who="The Youth">the youngest</character>,
            he went both far and long, as you shall hear.</p>
        <p>So it fell out one night as he was going through a great wood that such bad weather
            overtook him. It blew, and sleeted, and drove so that he could scarce keep his eyes
            open; and in a trice, before he knew how it was, he got bewildered, and could not find
            either road or path. But as he went on and on, at last he saw a glimmering of light far
            far off in the wood. So he thought he would try and get to the light; and after a time
            he did reach it. There it was in a large house, and the fire was blazing so brightly
            inside, that he could tell the folk had not yet gone to bed; so he went in and saw an
                <character who="Old Dame">old dame</character> bustling about and minding the
            house.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Old Dame">“Good evening!”</dialogue> said

        <p><dialogue subject="Old Dame" speaker="The Youth">“Hutetu! it’s such foul weather out of

        <p><dialogue subject="The Youth" speaker="Old Dame">“So it is”</dialogue>, said she.</p>
        <p><dialogue subject="Old Dame" speaker="The Youth">“Can I get leave to have a bed and

        <p><dialogue subject="The Youth" speaker="Old Dame">“You’ll get no good by sleeping

        <p><dialogue subject="Old Dame" speaker="The Youth">“What sort of folk, then, are they who

        <p><dialogue speaker="Old Dame" subject="The Youth">“Oh, robbers! And a bad lot of them
                too”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Old Dame">old dame</character>. <dialogue

        <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Old Dame">“Well, for all that, I think I’ll just

                <dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Old Dame">“Come what may, I’ll not stir out
                at night in such weather.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Old Dame" subject="The Youth">“Very well”</dialogue>, said the

                subject="The Youth">“but if you stay, it will be the worse for you.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>With that <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> got into a bed which stood
            there, but he dared not go to sleep, and very soon after in came <character
                who="Robbers">the robbers</character>; so the <character who="Old Dame">old
                dame</character> told them how a stranger fellow had come in whom she had not been
            able to get out of the house again.</p>
        <p><dialogue subject="Old Dame" speaker="Robbers">“Did you see if he had any
                money?”</dialogue> said <character who="Robbers">the robbers</character>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Old Dame" subject="Robbers">“Such a one as he money!”</dialogue> said
            the <character who="Old Dame">old dame</character>, <dialogue subject="Robbers"
                speaker="Old Dame">“<descriptor speaker="Old Dame" subject="The Youth"
                    sign="negative">the tramper</descriptor>! Why, if he had clothes to his back, it
                was as much as he had.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Then <character who="Robbers">the robbers</character> began to talk among themselves what
            they should do with him; if they should kill him outright, or what else they should do.
            Meantime <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> got up and began to talk to
            them, and to ask if they didn’t want a servant, for it might be that <action
                subject="Robbers" actor="The Youth" sign="positive">he would be glad to enter their
                service</action>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Robbers" subject="The Youth">“Oh”</dialogue>, said they, <dialogue
                speaker="Robbers" subject="The Youth">“if you have a mind to follow the trade that
                we follow, you can very well get a place here.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Robbers">“It’s all one to me what trade I
                follow”</dialogue>, said <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>; <dialogue
                subject="Robbers" speaker="The Youth">“for when I left home, father gave me leave to
                take to any trade I chose.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Robbers" subject="The Youth">“Well, have you a mind to
                steal?”</dialogue> asked the robbers.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Robbers">“I don’t care”</dialogue>, said
                <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>, for he thought it would not take
            long to learn that trade.</p>
        <p>Now there lived<character who="Rancher"> a man a little way off who had three
                oxen</character>. One of these he was to take to the town to sell, and <character
                who="Robbers">the robbers</character> had heard what he was going to do, so they
            said to <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>, if he were good to steal the
            ox from the man by the way without his knowing it, and without doing him any harm, they
            would give him leave to be their serving-man.</p>
        <p>Well! <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> set off, and <action
                subject="Robbers" actor="The Youth" sign="negative">took</action> with him a pretty
            shoe, with a silver buckle on it, which lay about the house; and he put the shoe in the
            road along which <character who="Rancher">the man</character> was going with his ox; and
            when he had done that, he went into the wood and hid himself under a bush. So when the
            man came by he saw the shoe at once.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Self">“That’s a nice shoe”</dialogue>, said he.
                <dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Self">“If I only had the fellow to it, I’d take
                it home with me, and perhaps I’d put my <character who="Rancher's Wife">old
                    dame</character> in a good humour for once.”</dialogue> For you must know he had
            an old wife, so <descriptor subject="Rancher's Wife" speaker="Narrator" sign="negative"
                >cross and snappish</descriptor>, it was not long between each time that she boxed
            his ears. But then he bethought him that he could do nothing with the odd shoe unless he
            had the fellow to it; so he went on his way and let the shoe lie on the road.</p>
        <p>Then <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> took up the shoe, and made all the
            haste he could to get before the man by a short cut through the wood, and laid it down
            before him in the road again. When the man came along with his ox, <action
                actor="Rancher" subject="Self" sign="negative">he got quite angry with
                himself</action> for being so <descriptor speaker="Self" subject="Rancher"
                sign="negative">dull</descriptor> as to leave the fellow to the shoe lying in the
            road instead of taking it with him; so he tied the ox to the fence, and said to himself,
                <dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Self">“I may just as well run back and pick up
                the other, and then I’ll have a pair of good shoes for my <character
                    who="Rancher's Wife">old dame</character>, and so, perhaps, I’ll get a kind word
                from her for once.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So he set off, and hunted and hunted up and down for the shoe, but no shoe did he find;
            and at length he had to go back with the one he had. But, meanwhile <character
                who="The Youth">the youth</character> had <action actor="The Youth"
                subject="Rancher" sign="negative">taken the ox</action> and gone off with it; and
            when the man came and saw his ox gone, he began to cry and bewail, for he was afraid his
                <character who="Rancher's Wife">old dame</character> would kill him outright when
            she came to know that the ox was lost. But just then it came across his mind that he
            would go home and take the second ox, and drive it to the town, and not let his
                <character who="Old Dame">old dame</character> know anything about the matter. So he
            did this, and went home and took the ox without his dame’s knowing it, and set off with
            it to the town. But <character who="Robbers">the robbers</character> knew all about it,
            and they said to <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>, if he could get this
            ox too, without the man’s knowing it, and without his doing him any harm, he should be
            as good as any one of them. If that were all, <character who="The Youth">the
                youth</character> said, he did not think it a very hard thing.</p>
        <p>This time he took with him a rope, and hung himself up under the arm-pits to a tree right
            in the man’s way. So the man came along with his ox, and when he saw such a sight
            hanging there he began to feel a little queer.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“Well”</dialogue>, said he, <dialogue
                speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“whatever heavy thoughts you had who have
                hanged yourself up there, it can’t be helped; you may hang for what I care! I can’t
                breathe life into you again”</dialogue>; and with that he went on his way with his
            ox. Down slipped the youth from the tree, and ran by a footpath, and got before the man,
            and hung himself up right in his way again.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“Bless me!”</dialogue> said the man,
                <dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“were you really so heavy at heart
                that you hanged yourself up there—or is it only a piece of witchcraft that I see
                before me? Aye, aye! you may hang for all I care, whether you are a ghost or
                whatever you are.”</dialogue> So he passed on with his ox.</p>
        <p>Now <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> did just as he had done twice
            before; he jumped down from the tree, ran through the wood by a footpath, and hung
            himself up right in the man’s way again. But when the man saw this sight for the third
            time, he said to himself:</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“Well! this is an ugly business! Is it
                likely now that they should have been so heavy at heart as to hang themselves, all
                these three? No! I cannot think it is anything else than a piece of witchcraft that
                I see. But now I’ll soon know for certain; if the other two are still hanging there,
                it must be really so; but if they are not, then it can be nothing but witchcraft
                that I see.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So he tied up his ox, and ran back to see if the others were still really hanging there.
            But while he went and peered up into all the trees, <character who="The Youth">the
                youth</character> jumped down and <action subject="Rancher" actor="The Youth"
                sign="negative">took his ox</action> and ran off with it. When the man came back and
            found his ox gone, he was in a sad plight, and, as any one might know without being
            told, he began to cry and bemoan; but at last he came to take it easier, and so he
            thought:</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Self">“There’s no other help for it than to go home
                and take the third ox without my dame’s knowing it, and to try and drive a good
                bargain with it, so that I may get a good sum of money for it.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So he went home and set off with the ox, and his <character who="Rancher's Wife">old
                dame</character> knew never a word about the matter. But <character who="Robbers"
                >the robbers</character>, they knew all about it, and they said to <character
                who="The Youth">the youth</character>, that if he could steal this ox as he had
            stolen the other two, then he should be master over the whole band. Well, <character
                who="The Youth">the youth</character> set off, and ran into the wood; and as the man
            came by with his ox he set up a dreadful bellowing, just like a great ox in the wood.
            When the man heard that, you can’t think how glad he was, for it seemed to him that he
            knew the voice of his big bullock, and he thought that now he should find both of them
            again; so he tied up the third ox, and ran off from the road to look for them in the
            wood; but meantime <character who="The Youth">the youth</character><action
                subject="Rancher" actor="The Youth" sign="negative"> went off with the third
                ox</action>. Now, when the man came back and found he had lost this ox too, he was
            so wild that there was no end to his grief. He cried and roared and beat his breast,
            and, to tell the truth, it was many days before he dared go home; for he was afraid lest
            his <character who="Rancher's Wife">old dame</character> should kill him outright on the spot.</p>
            <p>As for <character who="Robbers">the robbers</character>, they were not very well pleased
            either, when they had to own that <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> was
            master over the whole band. So one day they thought they would try their hands at
            something which he was not man enough to do; and they set off all together, every man
            Jack of them, and left him alone at home. Now, the first thing that he did when they
            were all well clear of the house, was to drive the oxen out to the road, so that they
            might run back to the man from whom he had stolen them; and right glad he was to see
            them, as you may fancy. Next he took all the horses which <character who="Robbers">the
                robbers</character> had, and loaded them with the best things he could lay his hands
            on-gold and silver, and clothes and other fine things; and then he bade the <character
                who="Old Dame">old dame</character> to greet <character who="Robbers">the
                robbers</character> when they came back, and to thank them for him, and to say that
            now he was setting off on his travels, and they would have hard work to find him again;
            and with that, off he started.</p> 
            <p>After a good bit he came to the road along which he was
            going when he fell among the robbers, and when he got near home, and could see his
            father’s cottage, he put on a uniform which he had found among the clothes he had taken
            from <character who="Robbers">the robbers</character>, and which was made just like a
            general’s. So he drove up to the door as if he were any other great man. After that he
            went in and asked if he could have a lodging? No; that he couldn’t at any price.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“How ever should I be able”</dialogue>, said the man, <dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="The Youth">“to make room in my house for such a fine
            gentleman—I who scarce have a rag to lie upon, and miserable rags too?”</dialogue></p> 
            <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Rancher">“You always were a stingy old hunks”</dialogue>, said <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>, <dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Rancher">“and so you
            are still, when you won’t take your own son in.”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="The Youth" speaker="Rancher">“What, you my son!”</dialogue> said the man.</p> 
            <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Rancher">“Don’t you know me again?”</dialogue> said <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>. Well,
            after a little while he did know him again.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="The Youth" speaker="Rancher">“But what have you been turning your hand to, that you have made yourself so great a man in such haste?”</dialogue> asked the man.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="The Youth" subject="Rancher">“Oh! I’ll soon tell you”</dialogue>, said <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>. <dialogue subject="Rancher" speaker="The Youth">“You said I might
            take to any trade I chose, and so I bound myself apprentice to a pack of thieves and
            robbers, and <transformation subject="The Youth" form="Master Thief">now I’ve served my time out, and am become a <character who="Master Thief"
                >Master Thief</character>.”</transformation ></dialogue></p>
            <p>Now there lived a <character who="Squire">Squire</character> close by to his father’s cottage, and he had such a great house,
            and such heaps of money, he could not tell how much he had. He had a daughter too, and a
            smart and pretty girl she was. So the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character> set his heart upon having her to wife, and he told his father to
            go to the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> and ask for his daughter for him.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Master Thief" subject="Rancher">“If he asks by what trade I get my living, you can say I’m a <character
                who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character>.”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Master Thief" speaker="Rancher">“I think you’ve lost your wits”</dialogue>, said the man, <dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Master Thief">“for you can’t be in your right mind when you think of such stuff.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>No! he had not lost his wits, his father must and should go to the <character who="Squire"
                >Squire</character>, and ask for his daughter.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Master Thief">“Nay, but I tell you, I daren’t go to the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> and be your spokesman; he who is so rich,
            and has so much money”</dialogue>, said the man.</p>
            <p>Yes, there was no help for it, said the <character
                who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character>; he should go whether he would or no;
            and if he did not go by fair means, he would soon make him go by foul. But the man was
            still loath to go; so he stepped after him, and rubbed him down with a good birch
            cudgel, and kept on till the man came crying and sobbing inside the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character>’s door.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Rancher" speaker="Squire">“How now, my man! what ails you?”</dialogue> said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>. So he told him the whole story; how he
            had three sons who set off one day, and how he had given them leave to go whithersoever
            they would, and to follow whatever calling they chose. <dialogue speaker="Rancher" subject="Squire">“And here now is the youngest
            come home, and has thrashed me till he has made me come to you and ask for your daughter
            for him to wife; and he bids me say, besides, that he’s a Master Thief.”</dialogue> And so he fell
            to crying and sobbing again.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Rancher" speaker="Squire">“Never mind, my man”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>, laughing; <dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Rancher">“just go back and tell him from me, he must prove his
            skill first. If he can steal the roast from the spit in the kitchen on Sunday, while all
            the household are looking after it, he shall have my daughter. Just go and tell him
            that.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>So he went back and told <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>, who
            thought it would be an easy job. So he set about and caught three hares alive, and put
            them into a bag, and dressed himself in some old rags, until he looked so poor and
            filthy that it made one’s heart bleed to see; and then he stole into the passage at the
            back-door of the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s house on the Sunday
            forenoon, with his bag, just like any other beggar-boy. But the <character who="Squire"
                >Squire</character> himself and all his household were in the kitchen watching the
            roast. Just as they were doing this, <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>
            let one hare go, and it set off and ran round and round the yard in front of the house.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Squire" speaker="Kitchen Folk">“Oh, just look at that hare!”</dialogue> said the <character who="Kitchen Folk">folk in the kitchen</character>, and were all for running out
            to catch it.</p> 
            <p>Yes, the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> saw it running too.
            <dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Kitchen Folk">“Oh, let it run”</dialogue>, said he; <dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Kitchen Folk">“there’s no use in thinking to catch a hare on the spring.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>A little while after, <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> let the second hare
            go, and they saw it in the kitchen, and thought it was the same they had seen before,
            and still wanted to run out and catch it; but the <character who="Squire"
                >Squire</character> said again it was no use. It was not long before <character
                who="The Youth">the youth</character> let the third hare go, and it set off and ran
            round and round the yard as the others before it. Now, they saw it from the kitchen, and
            still thought it was the same hare that kept on running about, and were all eager to be
            out after it.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Kitchen Folk">“Well, it is a fine hare”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>; <dialogue speaker="Squire">“come let’s see if we can’t lay our hands on it.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>So out he ran, and the rest with him—away they all went, the hare before, and they after; so that
            it was rare fun to see. But meantime <character who="The Youth">the youth</character>
            took the roast and ran off with it; and where the <character who="Squire"
                >Squire</character> got a roast for his dinner that day I don’t know; but one thing
            I know, and that is, that he had no roast hare, though he ran after it till he was both
            warm and weary.</p>
            <p>Now it chanced that the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> came to dinner that day, and when the
                <character who="Squire">Squire</character> told him what a trick the <character
                who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> had played him, he made such game of him
            that there was no end of it.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Squire" speaker="Priest">“For my part”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>,<dialogue speaker="Priest" subject="Squire"> “I can’t think how it could
            ever happen to me to be made such a fool of by a fellow like that.”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Priest">“Very well—only keep a sharp look-out”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>; <dialogue subject="Priest" speaker="Squire">“maybe he’ll
            come to see you before you know a word of it.”</dialogue> But the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> stuck to his text—that he
            did, and made game of the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> because he had been
            so taken in.</p>
            <p>Later in the afternoon came the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character>, and wanted to have the <character who="Squire"
            >Squire</character>’s daughter, as he had given his word. But the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character> began to talk him over, and said, <dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Master Thief">“Oh, you must
            first prove your skill a little more; for what you did to-day was no great thing, after
            all. Couldn’t you now play off a good trick on the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>, who is sitting in there, and
            making game of me for letting such a fellow as you twist me round his thumb.”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Squire" speaker="Master Thief">“Well, as for that, it wouldn’t be hard”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character>. So he dressed himself up like a bird, <transformation subject="Master Thief" form="Goose">threw a great white sheet
            over his body, took the wings of a goose and tied them to his back</transformation>, and so climbed up
            into a great maple which stood in the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>’s garden. And when the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> came home in
            the evening, <character who="The Youth">the youth</character> began to bawl out:</p>
            <p>“Father Laurence! Father Laurence!”—for that was the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>’s name.</p>
            <p>“Who is that calling me?” said the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>.</p>
            <p><transformation subject="Master Thief" form="Angel"><dialogue subject="Priest" speaker="Master Thief">“I am an angel”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character></transformation>, <dialogue speaker="Master Thief" subject="Priest">“sent from God to let you know
            that you shall be taken up alive into heaven for your piety’s sake. Next Monday night
            you must hold yourself ready for the journey, for I shall come then to fetch you in a
            sack; and all your gold and your silver, and all that you have of this world’s goods,
            you must lay together in a heap in your dining-room.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>Well, <character who="Priest">Father Laurence</character> fell on his knees before the angel, and thanked him; and the very next day he preached a farewell
            sermon, and gave it out how there had come down an angel unto the big maple in his
            garden, who had told him that he was to be taken up alive into heaven for his piety’s
            sake; and he preached and made such a touching discourse, that all who were at church
            wept, both young and old.</p>
            <p>So the next Monday night came the <character
                who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> like an angel again, and the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> fell
            on his knees and thanked him before he was put into the sack; but when he had got him
            well in, the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> <action subject="Priest" actor="Master Thief" sign="negative">drew and dragged him over stocks and stones.</action></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Master Thief" speaker="Priest">“OW! OW!”</dialogue> groaned the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> inside the sack,<dialogue speaker="Priest" subject="Master Thief"> “wherever are we going?”</dialogue></p>
            <p>“This is the narrow way which leadeth unto the kingdom of heaven”, said the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character>, who went on dragging him along till he had nearly broken every
            bone in his body. At last he tumbled him into a goose-house that belonged to the
                <character who="Squire">Squire</character>, and the geese began pecking and pinching
            him with their bills, so that he was more dead than alive.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Priest" speaker="Master Thief">“Now you are in the flames of purgatory, to be cleansed and purified for life everlasting”</dialogue>, said the Master Thief; and
            with that he went his way, and took all the gold which the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> had laid together in
            his dining-room. The next morning, when the <character who="Goose Girl">goose-girl</character> came to let the geese out, she
            heard how the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> lay in the sack, and bemoaned himself in the goose-house.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Priest" subject="Goose Girl">“In heaven’s name, who’s there, and what ails you?”</dialogue> she cried.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Goose Girl" speaker="Priest">“Oh!”</dialogue> said the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>, <dialogue speaker="Priest" subject="Goose Girl">“if you are an angel from heaven, do let me out, and let me return again to earth, for it is
            worse here than in hell. The little fiends keep on pinching me with tongs.”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Priest" speaker="Goose Girl">“Heaven help us, I am no angel at all”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Goose Girl">girl</character>, as she helped the <character who="Priest">Priest</character> out of the sack; <dialogue subject="">“I
            only look after the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s geese, and like enough
            they are the little fiends which have pinched your reverence."</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Priest" subject="Goose Girl">“Oh!”</dialogue> groaned the <character who="Priest">Priest</character>, <dialogue subject="Goose Girl" speaker="Priest">“this is all that <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character>’s doing. Ah! my
            gold and my silver, and my fine clothes.”</dialogue> And he beat his breast, and hobbled home at
            such a rate that the girl thought he had lost his wits all at once.</p>
            <p>Now when the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> came to hear how it had gone with the
            <character who="Priest">Priest</character>, and how he had been along the narrow way, and into purgatory, he laughed till he
            well-nigh split his sides. But when the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character> came and asked for his daughter as he had promised, the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character> put him off again, and said:</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Squire" subject="Master Thief">“You must do one masterpiece better still, that I may see plainly what you are fit for. Now, I have
            twelve horses in my stable, and on them I will put twelve grooms, one on each. If you
            are so good a thief as to steal the horses from under them, I’ll see what I can do for
            you.”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Squire" speaker="Master Thief">“Very well, I daresay I can do it”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character>; “but shall I really have your daughter if I can?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, if you can, I’ll do my best for you”, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>. So
            the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> set off to a shop, and bought
            brandy enough to fill two pocket-flasks, and into one of them he put a sleepy drink, but
            into the other only brandy. After that he hired eleven men to lie in wait at night,
            behind the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s stable-yard; and last of all,
            for fair words and a good bit of money, he borrowed a ragged gown and cloak from an old
            woman; and so, with a staff in his hand, and a bundle at his back, he limped off, as
            evening drew on, towards the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s stable. Just
            as he got there they were watering the horses for the night, and had their hands full of
            work. “What the devil do you want?” said one of the grooms to the old woman.</p>
            <p>“Oh, oh! hutetu! it is so bitter cold”, said she, and shivered and shook, and made wry faces.
            “Hutetu! it is so cold, a poor wretch may easily freeze to death”; and with that she
            fell to shivering and shaking again.</p>
            <p>“Oh! for the love of heaven, can I get leave to
            stay here a while, and sit inside the stable door?”</p>
            <p>“To the devil with your leave”, said one. “Pack yourself off this minute, for if the <character who="Squire"
                >Squire</character> sets his eye on you, he’ll lead us a pretty dance.”</p>
            <p>“Oh! the poor old bag-of-bones”, said another, whose heart took pity on her, “the old hag may sit
            inside and welcome; such a one as she can do no harm.”</p>
            <p>And the rest said, some she should stay, and some she shouldn’t; but while they were quarrelling and minding the
            horses, she crept further and further into the stable, till at last she sat herself down
            behind the door; and when she had got so far, no one gave any more heed to her.</p>
            <p>As the night wore on, the men found it rather cold work to sit so still and quiet on horseback.</p>
            <p>“Hutetu! it is so devilish cold”, said one, and beat his arms crosswise.</p>
            <p>“That it is”, said another; “I freeze so, that my teeth chatter.”</p>
            <p>“If one only had a quid to chew”, said a third.</p>
            <p>Well! there was one who had an ounce or two; so they shared it between
            them, though it wasn’t much, after all, that each got; and so they chewed and spat, and
            spat and chewed. This helped them somewhat; but in a little while they were just as bad
            as ever.</p>
            <p>“Hutetu!” said one, and shivered and shook.</p>
            <p>“Hutetu!” said the old woman, and shivered so, that every tooth in her head chattered. Then she pulled out the flask with
            brandy in it, and her hand shook so that the spirit splashed about in the flask, and
            then she took such a gulp, that it went “bop” in her throat.</p>
            <p>“What’s that you’ve got in your flask, old girl?” said one of the grooms.</p>
            <p>“Oh! it’s only a drop of brandy, old man”, said she.</p>
            <p>“Brandy! Well, I never! Do let me have a drop”, screamed the whole twelve, one after another.</p> 
            <p>“Oh! but it is such a little drop”, mumbled the old woman,
            “it will not even wet your mouths round.” But they must and would have it; there was no
            help for it; and so she pulled out the flask with the sleepy drink in it, and put it to
            the first man’s lips; then she shook no more, but guided the flask so that each of them
            got what he wanted, and the twelfth had not done drinking before the first sat and
            snored. Then the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> threw off his
            beggar’s rags, and took one groom after the other so softly off their horses, and set
            them astride on the beams between the stalls; and so he called his eleven men, and rode
            off with the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s twelve horses. But when the
                <character who="Squire">Squire</character> got up in the morning, and went to look
            after his grooms, they had just begun to come to; and some of them fell to spurring the
            beams with their spurs, till the splinters flew again, and some fell off, and some still
            hung on and sat there looking like fools.</p>
            <p>“Ho! ho!” said the <character who="Squire"
                >Squire</character>; “I see very well who has been here; but as for you, a pretty
            set of blockheads you must be to sit here and let the <character who="Master Thief"
                >Master Thief</character> steal the horses from between your legs.”</p>
            <p>So they all got a good leathering because they had not kept a sharper look-out.</p>
            <p>Further on in the day came the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> again, and told how he
            had managed the matter, and asked for the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s
            daughter, as he had promised; but the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> gave
            him one hundred dollars down, and said he must do something better still.</p>
            <p>“Do you think now”, said he, “you can steal the horse from under me while I am out riding on his
            back?” “O, yes! I daresay I could”, said the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character>, “if I were really sure of getting your daughter.”</p>
            <p>Well, well, the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> would see what he could do; and he told
            the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> a day when he would be taking
            a ride on a great common where they drilled the troops. So the <character
                who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> soon got hold of an old worn-out jade of
            a mare, and set to work, and made traces and collar of withies and broom-twigs, and
            bought an old beggarly cart and a great cask. After that he told an old beggar woman, he
            would give her ten dollars if she would get inside the cask, and keep her mouth agape
            over the taphole, into which he was going to stick his finger. No harm should happen to
            her; she should only be driven about a little; and if he took his finger out more than
            once, she was to have ten dollars more. Then he threw a few rags and tatters over
            himself, and stuffed himself out, and put on a wig and a great beard of goat’s hair, so
            that no one could know him again, and set off for the common, where the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character> had already been riding about a good bit. When he
            reached the place, he went along so softly and slowly that he scarce made an inch of
            way. “Gee up! Gee up!” and so he went on a little; then he stood stock still, and so on
            a little again; and altogether the pace was so poor it never once came into the
                <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s head that this could be the <character
                who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character>.</p>
            <p>At last the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> rode right up to him, and asked if he had seen any one lurking
            about in the wood thereabouts. “No”, said the man, “I haven’t seen a soul.”</p>
            <p>“Harkye, now”, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>, “if you have a mind to ride
            into the wood, and hunt about and see if you can fall upon any one lurking about there,
            you shall have the loan of my horse, and a shilling into the bargain, to drink my
            health, for your pains.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t see how I can go”, said the man, “for I am going to a
            wedding with this cask of mead, which I have been to town to fetch, and here the tap has
            fallen out by the way, and so I must go along, holding my finger in the taphole.”</p>
            <p>“Ride off”, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>; “I’ll look after your horse
            and cask.”</p>
            <p>Well, on these terms the man was willing to go; but he begged the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character> to be quick in putting his finger into the taphole
            when he took his own out, and to mind and keep it there till he came back. At last the
                <character who="Squire">Squire</character> grew weary of standing there with his
            finger in the taphole, so he took it out.</p>
            <p>“Now I shall have ten dollars more!” screamed
            the old woman inside the cask; and then the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>
            saw at once how the land lay, and took himself off home; but he had not gone far before
            they met him with a fresh horse, for the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character> had already been to his house, and told them to send one. The day
            after, he came to the <character who="Squire">Squire</character> and would have his
            daughter, as he had given his word; but the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>
            put him off again with fine words, and gave him two hundred dollars, and said he must do
            one more masterpiece. If he could do that, he should have her. Well, well, the
                <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> thought he could do it, if he
            only knew what it was to be.</p>
            <p>“Do you think, now”, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>, “you can steal the sheet off our bed, and the shift off my
            wife’s back. Do you think you could do that?”</p>
            <p>“It shall be done”, said the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character>. “I only wish I was as sure of getting
            your daughter.”</p>
            <p>So when night began to fall, the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character> went out and cut down a thief who hung on the gallows, and threw
            him across his shoulders, and carried him off. Then he got a long ladder and set it up
            against the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>’s bedroom window, and so climbed
            up, and kept bobbing the dead man up and down, just for all the world like one that was
            peeping in at the window.</p>
            <p>“That’s the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character>, old lass!” said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>,
            and gave his wife a nudge on the side. “Now see if I don’t shoot him, that’s all.”</p>
            <p>So saying he took up a rifle which he had laid at his bedside.</p>
            <p>“No! no! pray don’t shoot him after telling him he might come and try”, said his wife.</p>
            <p>“Don’t talk to me, for shoot him I will”, said he; and so he lay there and aimed and aimed; but as soon as the
            head came up before the window, and he saw a little of it, so soon was it down again. At
            last he thought he had a good aim; “bang” went the gun, down fell the dead body to the
            ground with a heavy thump, and down went the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character> too as fast as he could.</p>
            <p>“Well”, said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>, “it is quite true that I am the chief magistrate in these
            parts; but people are fond of talking, and it would be a bore if they came to see this
            dead man’s body. I think the best thing to be done is that I should go down and bury
            him.”</p>
            <p>“You must do as you think best, dear”, said his wife. So the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character> got out of bed and went downstairs, and he had
            scarce put his foot out of the door before the <character who="Master Thief">Master
                Thief</character> stole in, and went straight upstairs to his wife.</p>
            <p>“Why, dear, back already!” said she, for she thought it was her husband.</p>
            <p>“O yes, I only just put him into a hole, and threw a little earth over him. It is enough that he is out of sight, for it
            is such a bad night out of doors; by-and-by I’ll do it better. But just let me have the
            sheet to wipe myself with—he was so bloody—and I have made myself in such a mess with
            him.”</p>
            <p>So he got the sheet.</p>
            <p>After a while he said:</p>
            <p>“Do you know I am afraid you must let
            me have your nightshift too, for the sheet won’t do by itself; that I can see.”</p>
            <p>So she gave him the shift also. But just then it came across his mind that he had forgotten to
            lock the house-door, so he must step down and look to that before he came back to bed,
            and away he went with both shift and sheet.</p>
            <p>A little while after came the true <character who="Squire">Squire</character>.</p>
            <p>“Why! what a time you’ve taken to lock
            the door, dear!” said his wife; “and what have you done with the sheet and shift?”</p>
            <p>“What do you say?” said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>.</p>
            <p>“Why, I am asking what you have done with the sheet and shift that you had to wipe off the blood”, said she.</p>
            <p>“What, in the Deil’s name!” said the <character who="Squire">Squire</character>, “has he
            taken me in this time too?”</p>
            <p>Next day came the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> and asked for the <character
                who="Squire">Squire</character>’s daughter, as he had given his word; and then the
                <character who="Squire">Squire</character> dared not do anything else than give her
            to him, and a good lump of money into the bargain; for, to tell the truth, he was afraid
            lest the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> should steal the eyes
            out of his head, and that the people would begin to say spiteful things of him if he
            broke his word. So the <character who="Master Thief">Master Thief</character> lived well and happily from that time forward. I
            don’t know whether he stole any more; but if he did, I am quite sure it was only for the
            sake of a bit of fun.</p>

                meat, and <action actor="Hen" subject="self" sign="positive">sprang</action> up to a

            <p><dialogue speaker="Fox" subject="Hen">"Oh, stuff"</dialogue>, said the Fox; <dialogue

            <p>Now the <character who = "Fox">Fox</character> had hardly got the <character who = "Goose">Goose</character> well
                down his throat, before he did the very same with the <character who = "Duck">Duck</character>. He

            <p><dialogue speaker="Hen" subject="Fox">"Nay, nay; just see what a lovely lot of geese

        <title>THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND</title>
        <body>
            <p>Once on a time there was an <character who = "Old Widow">old widow</character> who had one
                <character who = "Son">son</character>; and as she was <descriptor speaker="Narrator"
                    subject="mother" sign="negative">poorly</descriptor> and <descriptor
                        speaker="Narrator" subject="mother" sign="negative">weak</descriptor>, her son had
                to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and
                was just going down the steps, there came the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>, <action
                    actor="North Wind" subject="meal" sign="negative">puffing</action> and <action
                        actor="North Wind" subject="meal" sign="negative">blowing</action>, caught up the
                meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the lad went back into the safe for
                more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>
                didn’t come again and carry off the meal with a <action actor="North Wind"
                    subject="meal" sign="negative">puff</action>; and, more than that, he did so the
                third time. At this the lad got very <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="lad"
                    sign="negative">angry</descriptor>; and as he thought it hard that the
                <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> should behave so, he thought he’d just look him
                up, and ask him to give up his meal.</p>
            <p>So off he went, but the way was long, and he <action actor="son" subject="environment"
                sign="positive">walked</action> and walked; but at last he came to the
                <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>’s house.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"Good day!"</dialogue> said the lad, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">and thank you for coming to see us
                yesterday.</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="son">"GOOD DAY!"</dialogue> answered the
                <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>, for his voice was <descriptor speaker="Narrator"
                    subject="North Wind" sign = "negative">loud</descriptor> and <descriptor speaker="Narrator"
                        subject="North Wind" sign = "negative">gruff</descriptor>, <dialogue speaker="North Wind"
                            subject="lad">"AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"Oh!"</dialogue> answered the lad, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let
                me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven’t much to
                live on; and if you’re to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there’ll be nothing
                for it but to starve."</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"I haven’t got your meal"</dialogue>, said the
                <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>; <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"but
                    if you are in such need, I’ll give you a cloth which will get you everything you
                    want, if you only say, “Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kind of good
                    dishes!” "</dialogue></p>
            <p>With this the <character who = "Son">lad</character> was well <descriptor speaker="Narrator"
                subject="lad" sign = "positive">content</descriptor>. But, as the way was so long he couldn’t get home
                in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down to
                supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said, <dialogue
                    speaker="lad" subject="cloth">"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good
                    dishes."</dialogue></p>
            <p>He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought it
                a fine thing, but most of all the <character who = "Landlady">landlady</character>. So, when all were
                fast asleep at dead of night, she took the lad’s cloth, and put another in its stead,
                just like the one he had got from the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>, but which
                couldn’t so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.</p>
            <p>So, when the <character who = "Son">lad</character> woke, he <action actor="lad" subject="cloth" sign = "positive"
                >took</action> his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his
                mother.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="mother">"Now"</dialogue>, said he, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="mother">"I’ve been to the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>’s
                house, and a <descriptor speaker="lad" subject="North Wind" sign = "positive">good</descriptor> fellow
                he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, ‘Cloth, spread
                yourself, and serve up all kind of good dishes’, I get any sort of food I
                please."</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"All very true, I daresay,"</dialogue> said
                his mother; <dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"but seeing is believing, and I
                    shan’t believe it till I see it."</dialogue></p>
            <p>So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said: <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="cloth">"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kind of good
                dishes."</dialogue></p>
            <p>But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="old widow">"Well"</dialogue>, said the
                <character who = "Son">lad</character>, <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="old widow">"there’s no
                    help for it but to go to the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> again"</dialogue>; and
                away he went. So he came to where the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> lived late in
                the afternoon.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"Good evening!"</dialogue> said the
                <character who = "Son">lad</character>. <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"Good
                    evening!"</dialogue> said the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>. <dialogue
                        speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"I want my rights for that meal of ours which you
                        took"</dialogue>, said the lad; <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"for, as
                            for that cloth I got, it isn’t worth a penny."</dialogue>
                <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"I’ve got no meal"</dialogue>, said the
                <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>; <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"but
                    yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to
                    it: ‘Rain, ram! make money!’"</dialogue></p>
            <p>So the <character who = "Son">lad</character> thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get
                home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before.</p>
            <p>Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the <character who = "North Wind">North
                Wind</character> had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the
                <character who = "Landlord">landlord</character> saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when
                the <character who = "Son">lad</character> had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn’t coin
                gold ducats, and changed the two.</p>
            <p>Next morning off went the <character who = "Son">lad</character>; and when he got home to his
                <character who = "Mother">mother</character>, he said: <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="old widow"
                    >"After all, the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> is a jolly fellow; for now he has
                    given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say ‘Ram, ram! make
                    money.’"</dialogue>
                <dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"All very true, I daresay"</dialogue>, said
                his <character who = "Mother">mother</character>; <dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"but I
                    shan’t believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="ram">"Ram, ram! make money!"</dialogue> said the
                <character who = "Son">lad</character>; but if the Ram made anything, it wasn’t money. So the
                <character who = "Son">lad</character> went back again to the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>,
                and <action actor="lad" subject="North Wind" sign = "negative">blew him up</action>, and said the ram was
                worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"Well!"</dialogue> said the <character who = "North Wind">North
                Wind</character>; <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"I’ve nothing else to
                    give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but it’s a stick of that kind that
                    if you say: “‘Stick, stick! lay on!’ it lays on till you say: ‘Stick, stick! now
                    stop!’"</dialogue></p>
            <p>So, as the way was long, the <character who = "Son">lad</character> turned in this night too to the
                <character who = "Landlord">landlord</character>; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood
                as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to <action
                    actor="lad" subject="environment" sign = "negative">snore</action>, as if he were asleep.</p>
            <p>Now the <character who = "Landlord">landlord</character>, who easily saw that the stick must be worth
                something, <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="landlord" sign = "negative">hunted</descriptor> up one
                which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but,
                just as the <character who = "Landlord">landlord</character> was about to <action actor="landlord"
                    subject="stick" sign = "negative">take</action> it, the lad bawled out: <dialogue speaker="lad"
                        subject="stick">"Stick, stick! lay on!"</dialogue></p>
            <p>So the stick began to <action actor="stick" subject="landlord" sign = "negative">beat</action> the
                <character who = "Landlord">landlord</character>, till he <action actor="landlord" subject="chair" sign = "negative"
                    >jumped</action> over chairs, and tables, and benches, and <action actor="landlord"
                        subject="environment" sign = "negative">yelled</action> and <action actor="landlord" subject="encironment" sign = "negative"
                            >roared</action>: <dialogue speaker="landlord" subject="lad">"Oh my! oh my! bid the

                                cloth and our ram."</dialogue></p>
            <p>When the <character who = "Son">lad</character> thought the <character who = "Landlord">landlord</character> had got
                enough, he said: <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="stick">"Stick, stick! now
                    stop!"</dialogue></p>
            <p>Then he <action actor="lad" subject="cloth" sign = "positive">took</action> the cloth and put it into his
                pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, <action actor="lad" subject="ram" sign = "negative"
                    >leading</action> the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for

        <title>WHY THE SEA IS SALT</title>
        <body>
            <p>Once on a time, but it was a long, long time ago, there were two brothers, one
                <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Rich Brother" sign="positive"
                    >rich</descriptor> and one <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Poor Brother"
                        sign="negative">poor</descriptor>. Now, one Christmas eve, the poor one hadn’t so
                much as a crumb in the house, either of meat or bread, so he went to his brother to ask
                him for something to keep Christmas with, in God’s name. It was not the first time his
                brother had been forced to help him, and you may fancy he wasn’t very glad to see his
                face, but he said:</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Rich Brother">“If you will do what I ask you to
                do, I’ll give you a whole flitch of bacon.”</dialogue> So the <character
                    who="Poor Brother">poor brother</character> said he would do anything, and was full
                of thanks.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Rich Brother">“Well, here is the
                flitch”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Rich Brother">rich brother</character>,
                “and now go straight to Hell.”</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Rich Brother" speaker="Poor Brother">“What I have given my word to do,
                I must stick to”</dialogue>, said the other; so he took the flitch and set off. He
                walked the whole day, and at dusk he came to a place where he saw a very bright
                light.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Self" speaker="Poor Brother">“Maybe this is the place”</dialogue>,
                said the man to himself. So he turned aside, and the first thing he saw was an old,
                <character who="Old Man">old man</character>, with a long white beard, who stood in
                an outhouse, hewing wood for the Christmas fire. </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue subject="Old Man" speaker="Poor Brother">“Good even”</dialogue>, said the man
                with the flitch.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Old Man">“The same to you; whither are you
                going so late?”</dialogue> said the man.</p>
            <p>
                <dialogue subject="Old Man" speaker="Poor Brother">“Oh! I’m going to Hell, if I only
                    knew the right way”</dialogue>, answered the poor man.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Old Man">“Well, you’re not far wrong, for this
                is Hell”</dialogue>, said the old man; <dialogue subject="Poor Brother"
                    speaker="Old Man">“when you get inside they will be all for buying your flitch, for
                    meat is scarce in Hell; but mind, you don’t sell it unless you get the hand-quern
                    which stands behind the door for it. When you come out, I’ll <action actor="Old Man"
                        subject="Poor Brother" sign="neutral"> teach</action> you how to handle the

            <p>So the man with the flitch <action actor="Poor Brother" subject="Old Man" sign="positive"
                >thanked</action> the other for his good advice, and gave a great knock at the

            <p> When he got in, everything went just as the old man had said. All the devils, great and
                small, came swarming up to him like ants round an anthill, and each tried to outbid the
                other for the flitch. </p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Devil" speaker="Poor Brother">“Well!”</dialogue> said the man,
                <dialogue subject="Devil" speaker="Poor Brother"> "by rights my old dame and I ought
                    to have this flitch for our Christmas dinner; but since you have all set your hearts
                    on it, I suppose I must give it up to you; but if I sell it at all, I’ll have for it
                    that quern behind the door yonder.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>At first the <character who="Devil">Devil</character> wouldn’t hear of such a bargain,
                and <action actor="Devil" subject="Poor Brother" sign="neutral">chaffered and
                    haggled</action> with the man; but he stuck to what he said, and at last the
                <character who="Devil">Devil</character> had to part with his quern. When the man
                got out into the yard, he asked the old woodcutter how he was to handle the quern; and
                after he had learned how to use it, he <action actor="Poor Brother" subject="Old Man"
                    sign="positive">thanked</action> the old man and went off home as fast as he could,
                but still the clock had struck twelve on Christmas eve before he reached his own
                door.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Poor Brother's Wife">“Wherever in the world
                have you been?”</dialogue> said his <character who="Poor Brother's Wife">old
                    dame</character>, <dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Poor Brother's Wife"
                        >“here have I sat hour after hour <action actor="Poor Brother's Wife"
                            subject="Poor Brother" sign="positive">waiting</action> and watching, without so
                        much as two sticks to lay together under the Christmas brose.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>
                <dialogue subject="Poor Brother's Wife" speaker="Poor Brother">“Oh!”</dialogue> said the
                man, <dialogue subject="Poor Brother's Wife" speaker="Poor Brother">“I couldn’t get back
                    before, for I had to go a long way first for one thing, and then for another; but
                    now you shall see what you shall see.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>So he put the quern on the table, and bade it first of all grind lights, then a
                table-cloth, then meat, then ale, and so on till they had got everything that was nice
                for Christmas fare. He had only to speak the word, and the quern ground out what he
                wanted. The old dame stood by blessing her stars, and kept on asking where he had got
                this wonderful quern, but he wouldn’t tell her.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother's Wife" speaker="Poor Brother">“It’s all one where I got
                it from; you see the quern is a good one, and the mill-stream never freezes, that’s
                enough.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>So he ground meat and drink and dainties enough to last out till Twelfth Day, and on the
                third day he asked all his friends and kin to his house, and gave a great feast. Now,
                when his <character who="Rich Brother">rich brother</character> saw all that was on the

            <p><dialogue subject="Party" speaker="Rich Brother">“’Twas only on Christmas

                    >“he was <descriptor subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Rich Brother" sign="negative"
                        >in such straits</descriptor>, that he came and asked for a morsel of food in
                    God’s name, and now he gives a feast <descriptor speaker="Rich Brother"
                        subject="Poor Brother" sign="negative">as if he were count or
                        king</descriptor>”</dialogue>; and he turned to his brother and said:</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Poor Brother" speaker="Rich Brother">“But whence, in Hell’s name, have
                you got all this wealth?”</dialogue></p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Rich Brother" speaker="Poor Brother">“From behind the
                door”</dialogue>, answered the <character who="Poor Brother">owner of the
                    quern</character>, for he didn’t care to <fig_lang type="Metaphor" subject="Quern"
                        relation="Revealing Secret" sign="negative">let the cat out of the bag</fig_lang>.
                But later on the evening, when he had got a drop too much, he could keep his secret no
                longer, and brought out the quern and said:</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Party" speaker="Poor Brother">“There, you see what has gotten me all
                this wealth”</dialogue>; and so he made the quern grind all kind of things. When his
                <character who="Rich Brother">brother</character> saw it, he set his heart on having
                the quern, and, after a deal of <action actor="Rich Brother" subject="Poor Brother"
                    sign="neutral">coaxing</action>, he got it; but he had to pay three hundred dollars
                for it, and <character who="Poor Brother">his brother</character> bargained to keep it
                till hay-harvest, for he thought, if I keep it till then, I can make it grind meat and
                drink that will last for years. So you may fancy the quern didn’t grow rusty for want of
                work, and when hay-harvest came, the <character who="Rich Brother">rich
                    brother</character> got it, but <character who="Poor Brother">the other</character>
                took care <action actor="Poor Brother" subject="Rich Brother" sign="negative">not to
                    teach</action> him how to handle it. </p>
            <p>It was evening when the <character who="Rich Brother">rich brother</character> got the
                quern home, and next morning he told his wife to go out into the hay-field and toss,
                while the mowers cut the grass, and he would stay at home and get the dinner ready. So,
                when dinner-time drew near, he put the quern on the kitchen table and said:</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Self" speaker="Rich Brother">“Grind herrings and broth, and grind them
                good and fast.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>So the quern began to grind herrings and broth; first of all, all the dishes full, then
                all the tubs full, and so on till the kitchen floor was quite covered. Then the man
                <action subject="Quern" actor="Rich Brother" sign="negative">twisted and
                    twirled</action> at the quern to get it to stop, but for all his twisting and
                fingering the quern went on grinding, and in a little while the broth rose so high that
                <character who="Rich Brother">the man</character> was like to drown. So he threw
                open the kitchen door and ran into the parlour, but it wasn’t long before the quern had
                ground the parlour full too, and it was only at the risk of his life that the man could
                get hold of the latch of the house door through the stream of broth. When he got the
                door open, he ran out and set off down the road, with the stream of herrings and broth
                at his heels, roaring like a waterfall over the whole farm. Now, <character
                    who="Rich Brother's Wife">his old dame</character>, who was in the field tossing
                hay, thought it a long time to dinner, and at last she said:</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Fieldworkers" speaker="Rich Brother's Wife">“Well! though <character
                who="Rich Brother">the master</character> doesn’t call us home, we may as well
                go. Maybe he finds it hard work to boil the broth, and will be glad of my
                help.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>The men were willing enough, so they sauntered homewards; but just as they had got a
                little way up the hill, what should they meet but herrings, and broth, and bread, all
                running and dashing, and splashing together in a stream, and the master himself <action
                    actor="Rich Brother" subject="Self" sign="negative">running before them for his
                    life</action>, and as he passed them he bawled out:</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Rich Brother" subject="Fieldworkers">“Would to heaven each of you had
                a hundred throats! but take care you’re not drowned in the broth.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>Away he went, as though the <character who="Devil">Evil One</character> were at his
                heels, to <character who="Poor Brother">his brother</character>’s house, and begged him
                for God’s sake to take back the quern that instant; for, said he:</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Rich Brother" subject="Poor Brother">“If it grinds only one hour more,
                the whole parish will be swallowed up by herrings and broth.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>But <character who="Poor Brother">his brother</character>
                <action actor="Poor Brother" subject="Rich Brother" sign="negative">wouldn’t hear of
                    taking it back</action> till the other paid him down three hundred dollars more.</p>
            <p>So the<character who="Poor Brother">poor brother</character> got both the money and the
                quern, and it wasn’t long before he <action actor="Poor Brother" subject="Rich Brother"
                    sign="negative">set up a farm-house far finer than the one in which his brother
                    lived</action>, and with the quern he ground so much gold that he covered it with
                plates of gold; and as the farm lay by the sea-side, the golden house gleamed and
                glistened far away over the sea. <transformation subject="Poor Brother" form="Rich Man">All who sailed by put ashore to see the <character
                    who="Poor Brother">rich man</character> in the golden house</transformation>, and to see the
                wonderful quern, the fame of which spread far and wide, till there was nobody who hadn’t
                heard tell of it.</p>
            <p>So one day there came a <character who="Skipper">skipper</character> who wanted to see
                the quern; and the first thing he <action subject="Poor Brother" actor="Skipper"
                    sign="neutral">asked</action> was if it could grind salt.</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Skipper" speaker="Poor Brother">“Grind salt!”</dialogue> said
                <character who="Poor Brother">the owner</character>; <dialogue subject="Skipper"
                    speaker="Poor Brother">“I should just think it could. It can grind
                    anything.”</dialogue> When the <character who="Skipper">skipper</character> heard
                that, he said he must have the quern, cost what it would; for if he only had it, he
                thought he should be rid of his long voyages across stormy seas for a lading of salt.
                Well, at first <character who="Poor Brother">the man</character> wouldn’t hear of
                parting with the quern; but the <character who="Skipper">skipper</character>
                <action actor="Skipper" subject="Poor Brother" sign="neutral">begged and prayed</action>
                so hard, that at last he let him have it, but he had to pay many, many thousand dollars
                for it. Now, when the <character who="Skipper">skipper</character> had got the quern on
                his back, he soon made off with it, for he was <action actor="Skipper"
                    subject="Poor Brother" sign="negative">afraid lest the man should change his
                    mind</action>; so he had no time to ask how to handle the quern, but got on board
                his ship as fast as he could, and set sail. When he had sailed a good way off, he
                brought the quern on deck and said:</p>
            <p><dialogue subject="Self" speaker="Skipper">“Grind salt, and grind both good and
                fast.”</dialogue></p>
            <p>Well, the quern began to grind salt so that it poured out like water; and when the
                <character who="Skipper">skipper</character> had got the ship full, he wished to
                stop the quern, but whichever way he turned it, and however much he tried, it was no
                good; the quern kept grinding on, and the heap of salt grew higher and higher, and at
                last down sank the ship. </p>
            <p>There lies the quern at the bottom of the sea, and grinds away at this very day, and
                that’s why the sea is salt.</p>

        <p>Once on a time there was a poor <character who = "Father">husbandman</character> who had so many
            children that he hadn’t much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children
            they all were, but the prettiest was the <character who = "Princess">youngest daughter</character>, who
            was so <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Princess" sign="positive">lovely there
                was no end to her loveliness.</descriptor></p>
        <p>So one day, ’twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall of the year, the weather was so
            wild and rough outside, and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew, till
            the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all sat round the fire busy with this
            thing and that. But just then, all at once something gave three taps on the window-pane.
            Then the <character who = "Father">father</character> went out to see what was the matter; and, when he
            got out of doors, what should he see but a <descriptor speaker="Narrator"

            <character who = "White Bear">White Bear.</character></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="father">“Good evening to you!”</dialogue> said
            the White Bear. <dialogue speaker="father" subject="White Bear">“The same to

                you give me your youngest daughter? If you will, I’ll make you as rich as you are

        <p>Well, <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="father" sign="negative">the man would not
                be at all sorry to be so rich</descriptor>; but still he thought he must have a bit
            of a talk with his daughter first; so he went in and told them how there was a
                <descriptor speaker="father" subject="White Bear" sign="positive">great</descriptor>
            <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> waiting outside, who had given his word to make them
            so rich if he could only have the youngest daughter.</p>
        <p>The lassie said <dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="father">“No!”</dialogue> outright.
            Nothing could get her to say anything else; so the man went out and settled it with the
            <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character>, that he should come again the next Thursday
            evening and get an answer. Meantime he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her
            of all the riches they would get, and how well off she would be herself; and so at last
            she thought better of it, and <action actor="daughter" subject="rags" sign="positive"
                >washed</action> and <action actor="daughter" subject="rags" sign="positive"
                >mended</action> her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and was ready to
            start. I can’t say her packing gave her much trouble.</p>
        <p>Next Thursday evening came the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> to <action
                actor="White Bear" subject="daughter" sign="negative">fetch</action> her, and she
            got upon his back with her bundle, and off they went. So, when they had gone a bit of
            the way, the White Bear said: <dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“Are you
                afraid?”</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="White Bear">“No! she wasn’t.”</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“Well! mind and hold tight by my
                shaggy coat, and then there’s nothing to fear”</dialogue>, said the Bear.</p>
        <p>So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great steep hill. There, on the face
            of it, the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> gave a knock, and a door opened, and they
            came into a castle, where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver
            and gold; and there too was a table ready laid, and it was all as grand as grand could
            be. Then the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character>
            <action actor="White Bear" subject="daughter" sign="positive">gave</action> her a silver
            bell; and when she wanted anything, she was only to ring it, and she would get it at
            once.</p>
        <p>Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore on, she got sleepy after her
            journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she <action actor="daughter"
                subject="bell" sign="positive">rang</action> the bell; and she had scarce taken hold
            of it before she came into a chamber, where there was a bed made, as fair and white as
            any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains, and gold fringe. All
            that was in the room was gold or silver; but when she had gone to bed, and put out the
            light, a <character who = "Prince">man</character> came and laid himself alongside her. <transformation
                form="man" subject="White Bear">That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast
                shape at night</transformation>; but she never saw him, for he always came after she
            had put out the light, and before the day dawned he was up and off again. So things went
            on happily for a while, but at last she began to get <descriptor speaker="Narrator"
                subject="daughter" sign="negative">silent</descriptor> and <descriptor

            there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go home to see her father and
            mother and brothers and sisters. So one day, when the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character>
            asked what it was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely there, and how she
            longed to go home to see her father and mother, and brothers and sisters, and that was
            why she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn’t get to them.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“Well, well!”</dialogue> said the
            Bear, <dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“perhaps there’s a cure for all
                this; but you must promise me one thing, not to talk alone with your mother, but
                only when the rest are by to hear; for she’ll take you by the hand and try to lead
                you into a room alone to talk; but you must mind and not do that, else you’ll bring
                bad luck on both of us.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So one Sunday the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> came and said now they could set off
            to see her father and mother. Well, off they started, she sitting on his back; and they

        <p><dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“This is where your father and mother

            <dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="self">“No! bless her, she’d not

                Bear</character> turned right about and left her.</p>
        <p>Then when she went in to see her father and mother, there was such <descriptor
                speaker="Narrator" subject="father and mother" sign="positive">joy</descriptor>,
            there was no end to it. None of them thought they could thank her enough for all she had
            done for them. Now, they had everything they wished, as good as good could be, and they
            all wanted to know how she got on where she lived.</p>
        <p>Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did; she had all she wished. What she
            said beside I don’t know; but I don’t think any of them had the right end of the stick,
            or that they got much out of her. But so in the afternoon, after they had done dinner,
            all happened as the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> had said. Her mother wanted to
            talk with her alone in her bed-room; but she minded what the <character who = "White Bear">White
                Bear</character> had said, and <action actor="daughter" subject="environment"
                sign="negative">wouldn’t go</action> upstairs.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="mother">“Oh! what we have to talk about, will
                keep”</dialogue>, she said, and put her mother off. But some how or other, her
            mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her the whole story. So she said, how
            every night, when she had gone to bed, a <character who = "Prince">man</character> came and <action
                actor="Prince" subject="daughter" sign="positive">lay</action> down beside her as
            soon as she had put out the light, and how she never saw him, because he was always up
            and away before the morning dawned; and how she went about <descriptor
                speaker="daughter" subject="Princess" sign="negative">woeful</descriptor> and
            sorrowing, for she thought she should so like to see him, and how all day long she
            walked about there alone, and how <descriptor speaker="daughter" subject="daughter"
                sign="negative">dull</descriptor>, and <descriptor speaker="daughter"
                subject="daughter" sign="negative">dreary</descriptor>, and lonesome it was.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="mother" subject="daughter">“My!”</dialogue> said her mother;
                <dialogue speaker="mother" subject="daughter">“it may well be a
                    <character who = "Troll">Troll</character> you slept with! But now I’ll teach you a lesson how
                to set eyes on him. I’ll give you a bit of candle, which you can carry home in your
                bosom; just light that while he is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on
                him.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Yes! she took the candle, and hid it in her bosom, and as night drew on, the
            <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> came and <action actor="White Bear"
                subject="daughter" sign="negative">fetched</action> her away. But when they had gone
            a bit of the way, the <character who = "White Bear">White Bear</character> asked if all hadn’t happened as
            he had said? <dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="White Bear">“Well, she couldn’t say
                it hadn’t.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“Now, mind”</dialogue>, said he,
                <dialogue speaker="White Bear" subject="daughter">“if you have listened to your
                mother’s advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and then, all that has passed
                between us will be as nothing.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="White Bear">“No”</dialogue>, she said, <dialogue
                speaker="daughter" subject="White Bear">“she hadn’t listened to her mother’s
                advice.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So when she reached home, and had gone to bed, it was the old story over again. There
            came a <character who = "Prince">man</character> and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when
            she heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, <action actor="daughter"
                subject="candle" sign="positive">lit</action> the candle, and let the light shine on
            him, and so she saw that he was the <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Prince"
                sign="positive">loveliest</descriptor>
            <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> one ever set eyes on, and she fell so deep in love with
            him on the spot, that she thought she couldn’t live if she didn’t give him a kiss there
            and then. And so she did, but as she <action actor="daughter" subject="Prince"
                sign="positive">kissed</action> him, she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his
            shirt, and he woke up.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“What have you done?”</dialogue> he cried;
                <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“now you have made us both unlucky,
                for had you held out only this one year, I had been freed. For I have a
                    <character who = "Stepmother">stepmother</character> who has <action actor="stepmother"
                    subject="Prince" sign="negative">bewitched</action> me, so that I am a White
                Bear by day, and a Man by night. But now all ties are snapt between us; now I must
                set off from you to her. She lives in a Castle which stands EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST
                O’ THE MOON, and there, too, is a <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character>, with a
                    <descriptor speaker="Prince" subject="Long Nose" sign="negative">nose three ells
                    long</descriptor>, and she’s the wife I must have now.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>She <action actor="daughter" subject="self" sign="negative">wept</action> and took it
            ill, but there was no help for it; go he must. Then she asked if she mightn’t go with
            him? No, she mightn’t. <dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="Prince">“Tell me the way,
                then”</dialogue>, she said, <dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="Prince">“and I’ll
                search you out; that surely I may get leave to do.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“Yes, she might do that”</dialogue>, he
            said; <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“but there was no way to that place.
                It lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON, and thither she’d never find her
                way.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So next morning, when she woke up, both <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> and castle were
            gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood,
            and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home.</p>
        <p>So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and <action actor="Princess"
                subject="self" sign="negative">wept</action> till she was tired, she <action
                actor="daughter" subject="self" sign="positive">set out</action> on her way, and
            walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an <character who = "Old Hag">old
                hag</character>, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Her the lassie
            asked if she knew the way to the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character>, who lived with his
            step-mother in the Castle, that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON, and who was to
            marry the <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character>
            <descriptor speaker="daughter" subject="Long Nose" sign="negative">with a nose three ells
                long</descriptor>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="old hag" subject="daughter">“How did you come to know about
                him?”</dialogue> asked the old hag; <dialogue speaker="old hag" subject="daughter"
                >“but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?”</dialogue> Yes, she was.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="old hag" subject="daughter">“So, so; it’s you, is it?”</dialogue>
            said the old hag. <dialogue speaker="old hag" subject="daughter">“Well, all I know about
                him is, that he lives in the castle that lies EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON,
                and thither you’ll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse,
                and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she’ll be able to tell you; and
                when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to
                be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So she got upon the horse, and <action actor="daughter" subject="horse" sign="positive"
                >rode</action> a long long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat
            <character who = "Old Hag">another old hag</character>, with a gold carding-comb. Her the lassie
            asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON,
            and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was
            east o’ the sun and west o’ the moon.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="second old hag" subject="daughter">“And thither you’ll come, late or
                never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she’ll
                tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left
                ear, and beg him to be off home.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>And this <character who = "Old Hag">old hag</character> gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be
            she’d find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far
            far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which
            sat <character who = "Old Hag">another old hag</character>, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her,
            too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay EAST
            O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON. So it was the same thing over again.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="third old hag" subject="daughter">“Maybe it’s you who ought to have
                had the Prince?”</dialogue> said the old hag. Yes, it was.</p>
        <p>But she, too, didn’t know the way a bit better than the other two. “<dialogue
                speaker="third old hag" subject="daughter">East o’ the sun and west o’ the moon it
                was”</dialogue>, she knew—that was all.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="third old hag" subject="daughter">“And thither you’ll come, late or
                never; but I’ll lend you my horse, and then I think you’d best ride to the
            <character who = "East Wind">East Wind</character> and ask him; maybe, he knows those parts, and
                can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch
                under the left ear, and he’ll trot home of himself.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. <dialogue speaker="third old hag"
                subject="daughter">“Maybe you’ll find a use for it”</dialogue>, said the old hag.</p>
        <p>Then on she <action actor="daughter" subject="horse" sign="positive">rode</action> many
            many days, a weary time, before she got to the <character who = "East Wind">East Wind</character>’s house,
            but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the <character who = "East Wind">East Wind</character> if
            he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east o’ the sun and west o’ the moon.
            Yes, the <character who = "East Wind">East Wind</character> had often heard tell of it, the
            <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> and the castle, but he couldn’t tell the way, for he
            had never blown so far.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="East Wind" subject="daughter">“But, if you will, I’ll go with you to
            my brother the <character who = "West Wind">West Wind</character>, maybe he knows, for he’s much
                    <descriptor speaker="East Wind" subject="West Wind" sign="positive"
                    >stronger</descriptor>. So, if you will just get on my back, I’ll carry you
                thither.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they <action actor="East Wind"
                subject="daughter" sign="positive">went briskly</action> along.</p>
        <p>So when they got there, they went into the <character who = "West Wind">West Wind</character>’s house, and
            the <character who = "East Wind">East Wind</character> said the lassie he had brought was the one who
            ought to have had the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> who lived in the castle EAST O’ THE
            SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with
            her, and would be glad to know if the <character who = "West Wind">West Wind</character> knew how to get
            to the castle.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="West Wind" subject="East Wind">“Nay”</dialogue>, said the West Wind,
                <dialogue speaker="West Wind" subject="East Wind">“so far I’ve never blown; but if
                    you will, I’ll go with you to our brother the <character who = "South Wind">South Wind</character>, for
                he’s much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide.
                Maybe he’ll tell you. You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you to him.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Yes! she got on his back, and so they <action actor="West Wind" subject="daughter"
            sign="positive">travelled</action> to the <character who = "South Wind">South Wind</character>, and
            weren’t so very long on the way, I should think.</p>
        <p>When they got there, the <character who = "West Wind">West Wind</character> asked him if he could tell her
            the way to the castle that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON, for it was she who
            ought to have had the prince who lived there.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="South Wind" subject="West Wind">“You don’t say so! That’s she, is
                it?”</dialogue> said the South Wind.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="South Wind" subject="West Wind">“Well, I have blustered about in most
                places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I’ll take you to
                my brother the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>; he is the <descriptor
                    speaker="South Wind" subject="North Wind" sign="positive">oldest</descriptor>
                and <descriptor speaker="South Wind" subject="North Wind" sign="positive"
                    >strongest</descriptor> of the whole lot of us, and if he don’t know where it
                is, you’ll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and
                I’ll carry you thither.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Yes! she got on his back, and away he <action actor="South Wind" subject="daughter"
                sign="positive">went from his house</action> at a fine rate. And this time, too, she
            wasn’t long on her way.</p>
        <p>So when they got to the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character>’s house, he was so <descriptor
                speaker="Narrator" subject="North Wind" sign="negative">wild</descriptor> and
                <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="North Wind" sign="negative"
                >cross</descriptor>, cold puffs came from him a long way off.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="South Wind">“BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU
                WANT?”</dialogue> he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it <action
                actor="North Wind" subject="South Wind" sign="negative">struck</action> them with an
            icy shiver.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="South Wind" subject="North Wind">“Well”</dialogue>, said the South
            Wind, <dialogue speaker="South Wind" subject="North Wind">“you needn’t be so
                foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the <character who = "South Wind">South Wind</character>,
                and here is the <character who = "Princess">lassie</character> who ought to have had the
                <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> who dwells in the castle that lies EAST O’ THE SUN
                AND WEST O’ THE MOON, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can
                tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again.”</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="South Wind">“YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT
                IS”</dialogue>, said the North Wind; <dialogue speaker="North Wind"
                subject="South Wind">“once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but I was so
                tired I couldn’t blow a puff for ever so many days after. But if you really wish to
                go thither, and aren’t afraid to come along with me, I’ll take you on my back and
                see if I can blow you thither.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Yes! <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="daughter" sign="positive">with all her
                heart</descriptor>; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way;
            and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn’t be at all afraid.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="South Wind">“Very well, then”</dialogue>, said
            the North Wind, <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="South Wind">“but you must sleep
                here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we’re to get thither at
                all.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Early next morning the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> woke her, and puffed himself
            up, and blew himself out, and made himself so <descriptor speaker="Narrator"
                subject="North Wind" sign="positive">stout</descriptor> and big, ’<descriptor
                speaker="Narrator" subject="North Wind" sign="negative">twas gruesome to look at
                him</descriptor>; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would
            never stop till they got to the world’s end.</p>
        <p>Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many
            houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds.</p>
        <p>So they tore on and on—no one can believe how far they went—and all the while they still
            went over the sea, and the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> got more and more weary,
            and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and
            drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="daughter">“Are you afraid?”</dialogue> said the
            North Wind. <dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="North Wind">“No!”</dialogue> she
            wasn’t.</p>
        <p>But they weren’t very far from land; and the <character who = "North Wind">North Wind</character> had still
            so much strength left in him that he managed to <action actor="North Wind"
                subject="daughter" sign="positive">throw</action> her up on the shore under the
            windows of the castle which lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON; but then he was so
            weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home
            again.</p>
        <p>Next morning the <character who = "Princess">lassie</character> sat down under the castle window, and
            began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the
            <character who = "Long Nose">Long-nose</character> who was to have the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character>.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="daughter">“What do you want for your gold apple,
                you lassie?”</dialogue> said the Long-nose, and threw up the window. <dialogue
                speaker="daughter" subject="Princess">“It’s not for sale, for gold or
                money”</dialogue>, said the lassie.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="daughter">“If it’s not for sale for gold or money,
                what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price”</dialogue>, said
            the Princess.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="daughter" subject="Princess">“Well! if I may get to the
            <character who = "Prince">Prince</character>, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you
                shall have it”</dialogue>, said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought.</p>
        <p>Yes! she might; that could be done. So the <character who = "Princess">Princess</character> got the gold
            apple; but when the <character who = "Princess">lassie</character> came up to the Prince’s bed-room at
            night he was fast asleep; she called him and <action actor="daughter" subject="Prince"
                sign="positive">shook</action> him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she
            could do she couldn’t wake him up. Next morning as soon as day broke, came the
            <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character> with the long nose, and drove her out again.</p>
        <p>So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her
            carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character> asked
            what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn’t for sale for gold or money, but if she
            might get leave to go up to the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> and be with him that
            night, the <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character> should have it. But when she went up she
            found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she <action actor="daughter"
                subject="Prince" sign="positive">shook</action>, and <action actor="daughter"
                subject="Prince" sign="negative">wept</action>, and prayed, she couldn’t get life
            into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the
            <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character> with the long nose, and chased her out again.</p>
        <p>So, in the day time, the <character who = "Princess">lassie</character> sat down outside under the castle
            window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the
            <character who = "Princess">Princess</character> with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up
            the window and asked what she wanted for it. The <character who = "Princess">lassie</character> said, as
            she had said twice before, it wasn’t for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up
            to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it.</p>
        <p>Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some
            <character who = "Christians">Christian folk</character> who had been carried off thither, and as they
            sat in their room, which was next the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character>, they had heard how
            a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running,
            and they told that to the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character>.</p>
        <p>That evening, when the <character who = "Long Nose">Princess</character> came with her sleepy drink, the
            <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> made as if he drank, but <action actor="Prince"
                subject="drink" sign="positive">threw</action> it over his shoulder, for he could
            guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the <character who = "Princess">lassie</character> came in, she
            found the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> wide awake; and then she told him the whole
            story how she had come thither.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“Ah”</dialogue>, said the Prince,
                <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“you’ve just come in the very nick of
                time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won’t have the
                    <character who = "Long Nose">Long-nose</character>, and you are the only woman in the world who
                can set me free. I’ll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash
                the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she’ll say yes, for she doesn’t
                know ’tis you who put them there; but that’s a work only for <character who = "Christians">Christian
                    folk</character>, and not for <descriptor speaker="Prince" subject="Trolls"
                    sign="negative">such a pack of</descriptor>
                    <character who = "Trolls">Trolls</character>, and so I’ll say that I won’t have any other for my
                bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>So there was great <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="daughter" sign="positive"
                >joy</descriptor> and <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Prince"
                sign="positive">love</descriptor> between them all that night. But next day, when
            the wedding was to be, the Prince said: <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="step mother"
                >“First of all, I’d like to see what my bride is fit for.”</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="step mother" subject="Prince">“Yes!”</dialogue> said the step-mother,
            with all her heart.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="step mother">“Well”</dialogue>, said the Prince,
                <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="step mother">“I’ve got a fine shirt which I’d
                like for my wedding shirt, but some how or other it has got three spots of tallow on
                it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride
                than the woman who’s able to do that. If she can’t, she’s not worth
                having.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose
            began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the
            bigger the spots grew.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="step mother" subject="Princess">“Ah!”</dialogue> said the old hag,
            her mother, <dialogue speaker="step mother" subject="Princess">“you can’t wash; let me
                try.”</dialogue></p>
        <p>But she hadn’t long taken the shirt in hand, before it got far worse than ever, and with
            all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the
            darker and uglier was the shirt.</p>
        <p>Then all the other <character who = "Trolls">Trolls</character> began to wash, but the longer it
            lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as
            if it had been up the chimney.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="Trolls">“Ah!”</dialogue> said the Prince, <dialogue
                speaker="Prince" subject="Trolls">“you’re none of you worth a straw you can’t wash.
            Why there, outside, sits a beggar <character who = "Princess">lassie</character>, I’ll be bound she
                knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN LASSIE!”</dialogue> he
            shouted.</p>
        <p>Well, in she came. <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“Can you wash this
                shirt clean, lassie, you?”</dialogue> said he. <dialogue speaker="daughter"
                subject="Prince">“I don’t know”</dialogue>, she said, <dialogue speaker="daughter"
                subject="Prince">“but I think I can.”</dialogue> And almost before she had taken it
            and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still. <dialogue
                speaker="Prince" subject="daughter">“Yes; you are the <character who = "Princess">lassie</character>
                for me”</dialogue>, said the Prince.</p>
        <p>At that the old hag <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="step mother" sign="negative"
                >flew into such a rage</descriptor>, she burst on the spot, and the
            <character who = "Princess">Princess</character>
            <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Princess" sign="negative">with the long
                nose</descriptor> after her, and the whole pack of <character who = "Trolls">Trolls</character>
            after her—at least I’ve never heard a word about them since.</p>
        <p>As for the <character who = "Prince">Prince</character> and <character who = "Princess">Princess</character>, they set
            free all the poor <character who = "Christians">Christian folk</character> who had been carried off and
            shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far
            as they could from the Castle that lay EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON.</p>

        <title>BOOTS AND HIS BROTHERS</title>
        <body>
            <p><descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots and Brothers" sign="neutral">Once on a time
                there was a <character who="Father">man</character> who had three sons,
                <character>Peter</character>, <character>Paul</character>, and <character
                    who="Boots">John</character>. John was Boots, of course, because he was the
                youngest.</descriptor>
                <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Father" sign="negative">I can’t say the man had
                    anything more than these three sons, for he hadn’t one penny to rub against
                    another</descriptor>; <action actor="Father" subject="Peter, Paul, Boots"
                        sign="negative">and so he told his sons over and over again they must go out into
                        the world and try to earn their bread, for there at home there was nothing to be
                        looked for but starving to death.</action></p>
            <p>Now,<descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="property" sign="neutral"> a bit off the man’s
                cottage was the king’s palace, and you must know, just against the king’s windows a
                great oak had sprung up, which was so stout and big that it took away all the light
                from the king’s palace.</descriptor>
                <action actor="King" subject="self" sign="neutral">The <character who="king"
                    >King</character> had said he would give many, many dollars to the man who could
                    fell the oak, but no one was man enough for that, for as soon as ever one chip of
                    the oak’s trunk flew off, two grew in its stead</action>. <action actor="King"
                        subject="self" sign="neutral">A well, too, the King had dug, which was to hold water
                        for the whole year; for all his neighbours had wells, but he hadn’t any, and that he
                        thought a shame. So the King said he would give any one who could dig him such a
                        well as would hold water for a whole year round, both money and goods; but no one
                        could do it, for the King’s palace lay high, high up on a hill, and they hadn’t dug
                        a few inches before they came upon the living rock</action>.</p>
            <p>But as the <character who="king">King</character> had set his heart on having these two
                things done, he had it given out far and wide, in all the churches of his kingdom, that
                he who could fell the big oak in the king’s court-yard, and get him a well that would
                hold water the whole year round, should have the Princess and half the kingdom. Well!
                you may easily know there was many a man who came to try his luck; but for all their
                hacking and hewing, and all their digging and delving, it was no good. The oak got
                bigger and stouter at every stroke, and the rock didn’t get softer either. So one day
                <action actor="Brothers" subject="self" sign="positive">those three brothers thought
                    they’d set off and try too, and their father hadn’t a word against it; for even if
                    they didn’t get the Princess and half the kingdom, it might happen they might get a
                    place somewhere with a good master; and that was all he wanted. So when the brothers
                    said they thought of going to the palace, their father said “yes” at once. So Peter,
                    Paul, and Jack went off from their home.</action></p>
            <p>Well! <action actor="Brothers" subject="something" sign="neutral">they hadn’t gone far
                before they came to a fir wood, and up along one side of it rose a steep hill-side,
                and as they went, they heard something hewing and hacking away up on-the hill among
                the trees</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="something">“I wonder now what it is that is hewing
                away up yonder?”</dialogue> said Jack.</p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“You’re always so clever with your
                    wonderings”, said Peter and Paul both at once. “What wonder is it, pray, that a
                    woodcutter should stand and hack up on a hill-side?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“Still, I’d like to see what it is, after
                all”</dialogue>, said Jack; and <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral"
                    >up he went</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“Oh, if you’re such a child, ’twill do you
                good to go and take a lesson”</dialogue>, bawled out his brothers after him.</p>
            <p>But Jack didn’t care for what they said; <action actor="Boots" subject="axe"
                sign="neutral">he climbed the steep hill-side towards where the noise came, and when
                he reached the place, what do you think he saw? why, an axe that stood there hacking
                and hewing, all of itself, at the trunk of a fir.</action></p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Axe">“Good day!” said Jack. “So you stand here all
                    alone and hew, do you?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Axe" subject="Boots">“Yes; here I’ve stood and hewed and hacked a long
                long time, waiting for you”</dialogue>, said the <character who="Axe"
                    species="Object">Axe</character>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“Well, here I am at last”</dialogue>, said Jack,
                as <action actor="Boots" subject="Axe" sign="neutral">he took the axe, pulled it off its
                    haft, and stuffed both head and haft into his wallet</action>.</p>
            <p>So when he got down again to his brothers, <action actor="Peter Paul" subject="Boots"
                sign="negative">they began to jeer and laugh at him</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“And now, what funny thing was it you saw
                up yonder on the hill-side?”</dialogue> they said.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Axe">“Oh, it was only an axe we heard”</dialogue>,
                said Jack.</p>
            <p>So when they had gone a bit farther, they came under a steep spur of rock, and up there
                <action actor="Brothers" subject="something" sign="neutral">they heard something
                    digging and shovelling.</action></p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="something">“I wonder now,” said Jack, “what it is
                    digging and shovelling up yonder at the top of the rock.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“Ah, you’re always so clever with your
                    wonderings”, said Peter and Paul again, “as if you’d never heard a woodpecker
                    hacking and pecking at a hollow tree.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="something">“Well, well”, said Jack, “I think it would
                    be a piece of fun just to see what it really is.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>And so <action actor="Boots" subject="Spade" sign="neutral">off he set to climb the rock,
                while the others laughed and made game of him. But he didn’t care a bit for that; up
                he clomb, and when he got near the top, what do you think he saw? Why, a spade that
                stood there digging and delving.</action></p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Spade">“Good day!” said Jack. “So you stand here all
                    alone, and dig and delve!”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Spade" subject="Boots">“Yes, that’s what I do”, said the Spade, “and
                    that’s what I’ve done this many a long day, waiting for you.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“Well, here I am”</dialogue>, said Jack again,
                as <action actor="Boots" subject="Spade" sign="neutral">he took the spade and knocked it
                    off its handle, and put it into his wallet, and then down again to his
                    brothers.</action></p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“Well, what was it, so rare and strange”,
                    said Peter and Paul, “that you saw up there at the top of the rock?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Spade">“Oh,”, said Jack, “nothing more than a spade;
                    that was what we heard.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>So they went on again a good bit, till they came to a brook. They were thirsty, all
                three, after their long walk, and so <action actor="Brothers" subject="self"
                    sign="neutral">they lay down beside the brook to have a drink</action>.</p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="water">“I wonder now”, said Jack, “where all this

            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“I wonder if you’re right in your head”,
                    said Peter and Paul, in one breath. “If you’re not mad already, you’ll go mad very
                    soon, with your wonderings. Where the brook comes from, indeed! Have you never heard
                    how water rises from a spring in the earth?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="water">“Yes! but still I’ve a great fancy to see where

            <p>So up <action actor="Boots" subject="Walnut" sign="neutral">alongside the brook he went,
                in spite of all that his brothers bawled after him. Nothing could stop him. On he
                went. So, as he went up and up, the brook got smaller and smaller, and at last, a
                little way farther on, what do you think he saw? Why, a great walnut, and out of
                that the water trickled.</action></p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Walnut">“Good-day!” said Jack again. “So you lie
                    here, and trickle and run down all alone?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Walnut" subject="Boots">“Yes, I do,” said the Walnut; “and here have

            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“Well, here I am”</dialogue>, said Jack, as he
                <action actor="Boots" subject="Walnut" sign="neutral">took up a lump of moss and
                    plugged up the hole, that the water mightn’t run out. Then he put the walnut into
                    his wallet, and ran down to his brothers</action>.</p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Peter Paul" subject="Boots">“Well now”, said Peter and Paul, “have
                    you found out where the water comes from? A rare sight it must have
                    been!”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Walnut">“Oh, after all, it was only a hole it ran out
                of”</dialogue>, said Jack; and so <action actor="Peter Paul" subject="Boots"
                    sign="negative">the others laughed and made game of him again, but Jack didn’t mind
                    that a bit</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“After all, I had the fun of seeing
                it”</dialogue>, said he. So when they had gone a bit farther, they came to the
                king’s palace; but as every one in the kingdom had heard how they might win the Princess
                and half the realm, if they could only fell the big oak and dig the king’s well, so many
                had come to try their luck that the oak was now twice as stout and big as it had been at
                first, for two chips grew for every one they hewed out with their axes, as I daresay you
                all bear in mind. So the <action actor="King" subject="everyone" sign="negative">King
                    had now laid it down as a punishment, that if any one tried and couldn’t fell the
                    oak, he should be put on a barren island, and both his ears were to be clipped
                    off</action>. But the two brothers didn’t let themselves be scared by that; they
                were quite sure they could fell the oak, and Peter, as he was eldest, was to <action
                    actor="Peter" subject="self" sign="negative">try his hand first; but it went with
                    him as with all the rest who had hewn at the oak; for every chip he cut out, two
                    grew in its place. So the king’s men seized him, and clipped off both his ears, and
                    put him out on the island</action>.</p>
            <p>Now <action actor="Paul" subject="self" sign="negative">Paul, he was to try his luck, but
                he fared just the same; when he had hewn two or three strokes, they began to see the
                oak grow, and so the king’s men seized him too, and clipped his ears, and put him
                out on the island; and his ears they clipped closer, because they said he ought to
                have taken a lesson from his brother.</action></p>
            <p>So now Jack was to try.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“If you will look like a marked sheep, we’re
                quite ready to clip your ears at once, and then you’ll save yourself some
                bother”</dialogue>, said the King; for he was angry with him for his brothers’
                sake.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“Well, I’d like just to try first”</dialogue>,
                said Jack, and so he got leave. Then <action actor="Boots" subject="Axe" sign="neutral"
                    >he took his axe out of his wallet and fitted it to its haft</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Axe">“Hew away!”</dialogue> said he to his axe; and
                <action actor="Axe" subject="oak" sign="positive">away it hewed, making the chips
                    fly again, so that it wasn’t long before down came the oak.</action></p>
            <p>When that was done, <action actor="Boots" subject="Spade" sign="neutral">Jack pulled out
                his spade, and fitted it to its handle.</action></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Spade">“Dig away!”</dialogue> said he to the spade;
                and so the <action actor="Spade" subject="well" sign="positive">spade began to dig and
                    delve till the earth and rock flew out in splinters, and so he had the well soon dug
                    out</action>, you may think.</p>
            <p>And when <action actor="Boots" subject="Walnut" sign="neutral">he had got it as big and
                deep as he chose, Jack took out his walnut and laid it in one corner of the well,
                and pulled the plug of moss out</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Walnut">“Trickle and run”</dialogue>, said Jack; and
                so the <action actor="Walnut" subject="well" sign="positive">nut trickled and ran, till
                    the water gushed out of the hole in a stream, and in a short time the well was
                    brimfull</action>.</p>
            <p>Then <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="positive">Jack had felled the oak which
                shaded the king’s palace, and dug a well in the palace-yard, and so he got the
                Princess and half the kingdom</action>, as the King had said; but it was lucky for
                Peter and Paul that they had lost their ears, else they had heard each hour and day, how
                every one said, <dialogue speaker="everyone" subject="Brothers">“Well, after all, Jack
                    wasn’t so much out of his mind when he took to wondering.”</dialogue></p>

            <p>Just opposite the palace, across a lake, <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Troll"
                sign="neutral">lived a Troll, who had seven silver ducks which swam on the lake, so

            <p><dialogue speaker="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots">“If our brother only chose, he has

            <p>You may fancy it wasn’t long before the coachman told this to the king; and the king
                called Boots before him, and said:</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“Your brothers say you can get me the silver

            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“I’m sure I never thought or said anything of

            <p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“You did say so, and you shall fetch

            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="King">“Well! well!” said the lad; “needs must, I

            </p>
            <p>So <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral">he got the rye and the wheat, and

            <p>When he got half over, the <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="negative"

            <p><descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots" sign="positive">So when he got back to the

            <p>Boots <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="negative">answered, he had never thought

                        pulled the quilt down, and rowed away with it as fast as he could.</action></p>
            <p>And when he was half across, <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="negative">out

            </p>
            <p>Yes! the coachman went and told the king, and he said to the lad:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Yes! he might have six days, but when they were over, he must set out.</p>
            <p>Then <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral">he took a tenpenny nail, a

            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“HO, HO!” roared the Troll; “is it you who

            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Aye! aye!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>
            <p>So the <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="negative">Troll caught hold of him at

            <p>She was willing enough, and <action actor="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots"

            <p>After another eight days the same thing happened, and this time <action actor="Boots"

                half.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>So when the Troll had been gone a little while, <action actor="Troll Daughter"
                subject="knife" sign="neutral">the daughter began to sharpen a great long
                knife</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="knife">“Is that what you’re going to kill me
                with?”</dialogue> asked the lad.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="knife">“Yes it is,”</dialogue> said she.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="knife">“But it isn’t sharp”, said the lad. “Just let
                me sharpen it for you, and then you’ll find it easier work to kill me.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><action actor="Boots" subject="Troll Daughter" sign="neutral">So she let him have the
                knife, and he began to rub and sharpen it on the whetstone.</action>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="knife">“Just let me try it on one of your hair
                plaits; I think it’s about right now.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><action actor="Boots" subject="Troll Daughter" sign="positive">So he got leave to do
                that; but at the same time that he grasped the plait of hair, he pulled back her
                head, and at one gash, cut off the Troll’s daughter’s head; and half of her he
                roasted and half of her he boiled, and served it all up.</action>
            </p>
            <p><action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="positive">After that he dressed himself in
                her clothes, and sat away in the corner.</action>
            </p>
            <p>So when the <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="neutral">Troll came home with his
                guests, he called out to his daughter—for he thought all the time it was his
                daughter—to come and take a snack.</action></p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“No, thank you”, said the lad, “I don’t care
                for food, I’m so sad and downcast.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Oh!” said the Troll, “if that’s all, you know
                the cure; take the harp, and play a tune on it.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Harp">“Yes!” said the lad; “but where has it got to;
                I can’t find it.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Harp">“Why, you know well enough”, said the Troll;
                “you used it last; where should it be but over the door yonder?</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>The lad did not wait to be told twice; <action actor="Boots" subject="self"
                sign="positive">he took down the harp, and went in and out playing tunes; but, all
                at once he shoved off the kneading-trough, jumped into it, and rowed off, so that
                the foam flew around the trough</action>.</p>
            <p>After a while the Troll thought his daughter was a long while gone,<action actor="Troll"
                subject="Boots" sign="negative"> and went out to see what ailed her; and then he saw
                the lad in the trough, far, far out on the lake</action>.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“HALLOA! Is it you”, he roared, “that took my
                seven silver ducks?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“AYE, AYE!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Is it you that took my bed-quilt, with the
                    gold and silver patches.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Yes!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“And now you have taken off my gold
                harp?”</dialogue> screamed the Troll.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Yes!” said the lad; “I’ve got it, sure
                enough.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“And haven’t I eaten you up after all,
                then?”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“No, no! ’twas your own daughter you
                ate”</dialogue>, answered the lad.</p>
            <p>But <action actor="Troll" subject="self" sign="negative">when the Troll heard that, he
                was so sorry, he burst</action>; and then <action actor="Boots" subject="self"
                    sign="positive">Boots rowed back, and took a whole heap of gold and silver with him,
                    as much as the trough could carry. And so, when he came to the palace with the gold
                    harp, he got the Princess and half the kingdom, as the king had promised him; and,
                    as for his brothers, he treated them well, for he thought they had only wished his
                    good when they said what they had said.</action></p>

            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Hold your tongue!” he cried to the

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“But you shall eat”, said the <character

                one could tell such a string of lies, as would get her to say, “That’s a story”, he
                should have her to wife, and half the kingdom besides. Well, many came, as you may
                fancy, to try their luck, for every one would have been very glad to have the Princess,
                to say nothing of the kingdom; but they all cut a sorry figure, for the Princess was so
                given to story-telling, that all their lies went in at one ear and out of the other.
                Among the rest came three brothers to try their luck, and the two elder went first, but
                they fared no better than those who had gone before them. Last of all the third,
                <character>Boots</character>, set off and found the <character>Princess</character>
                in the farm-yard.</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Princess">“Good-morning”, he said, “and thank you for

            </p>
            <p>Then she went on:</p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“You haven’t such a fine farm-yard as ours,
                I’ll be bound; for when two shepherds stand, one at each end of it, and blow their

            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Princess">“Haven’t we though!” answered Boots; “ours
                is far bigger; for when a cow begins to go with calf at one end of it, she doesn’t
                get to the other end before the time to drop her calf is come.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“I dare say!” said the Princess. “Well, but
                you haven’t such a big ox, after all, as ours yonder; for when two men sit one on

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Princess">“Stuff!” said Boots; “is that all? why, we

            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“I dare say!” said the Princess; “but you
                haven’t so much milk as we, I’ll be bound; for we milk our kine into great pails,
                and carry them in-doors, and empty them into great tubs, and so we make great, great
                cheeses.”</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Princess">“Oh! you do, do you?” said Boots. “Well, we
                milk ours into great tubs, and then we put them in carts and drive them in-doors,
                and then we turn them out into great brewing vats, and so we make cheeses as big as
                a great house. We had, too a dun mare to tread the cheese well together when it was
                making; but once she tumbled down into the cheese, and we lost her; and after we had
                eaten at this cheese seven years, we came upon a great dun mare, alive and kicking.
                Well, once after that I was going to drive this mare to the mill, and her back-bone
                snapped in two; but I wasn’t put out, not I, for I took a spruce sapling, and put it
                into her for a back-bone, and she had no other back-bone all the while we had her.
                But the sapling grew up into such a tall tree, that I climbed right up to heaven by
                it, and when I got there, I saw the Virgin Mary sitting and spinning the foam of the
                sea into pig’s-bristle ropes; but just then the spruce-fir broke short off, and I
                couldn’t get down again; so the Virgin Mary let me down by one of the ropes, and
                down I slipped straight into a fox’s hole, and who should sit there but my mother
                and your father cobbling shoes; and just as I stepped in, my mother gave your father
                such a box on the ear, that it made his whiskers curl.”</dialogue>
