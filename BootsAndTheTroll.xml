<story><title>BOOTS AND THE TROLL</title><body>
<p>Once on a time <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="the family" sign="negative">there was a poor man who had three sons. When he died, the two elder set off into the world to try their luck, but the <character who="Boots">youngest</character> they wouldn’t have with them at any price</descriptor>.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots"><misconception actor="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots" sign="negative">“As for you”, they said, “you’re fit for nothing but to sit and poke about in the ashes.”</misconception></dialogue></p>

<p><action actor="Elder Brothers" subject="self" sign="neutral">So the <character who="Elder Brothers">two</character> went off and got places at a palace—the one under the coachman, and the other under the gardener</action>. But <character>Boots</character>, <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="positive">he set off too, and took with him a great kneading-trough, which was the only thing his parents left behind them, but which the other two would not bother themselves with.</action> It was heavy to carry, but he did not like to leave it behind, and so, after <action actor="Boots" subject="Brothers" sign="neutral">he had trudged a bit, he too came to the palace, and asked for a place.</action> So <action actor="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots" sign="negative">they told him they did not want him,</action> but <action actor="Boots" subject="Elder Brothers" sign="neutral">he begged so prettily that at last he got leave to be in the kitchen, and carry in wood and water for the kitchen maid.</action> <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots" sign="Positive">He was quick and ready, and in a little while every one liked him</descriptor>; but <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Elder Brothers" sign="negative">the two others were dull, and so they got more kicks than halfpence, and grew quite envious of Boots, when they saw how much better he got on.</descriptor></p>

<p>Just opposite the palace, across a lake, <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Troll" sign="neutral">lived a Troll, who had seven silver ducks which swam on the lake, so that they could be seen from the palace.</descriptor> These the <character>king</character> had often longed for; and so the two elder brothers told the <character>coachman</character>:</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots">“If our brother only chose, he has said he could easily get the king those seven silver ducks.”</dialogue></p>

<p>You may fancy it wasn’t long before the coachman told this to the king; and the king called Boots before him, and said:</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“Your brothers say you can get me the silver ducks; so now go and fetch them.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“I’m sure I never thought or said anything of the kind,”</dialogue> said the <character who="Boots">lad</character>.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“You did say so, and you shall fetch them”</dialogue>, said the king, <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="King" sign="positive">who would hold his own.</descriptor></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="King">“Well! well!” said the lad; “needs must, I suppose; but give me a bushel of rye, and a bushel of wheat, and I’ll try what I can do.”</dialogue></p>

<p>So <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral">he got the rye and the wheat, and put them into the kneading-trough he had brought with him from home, got in, and rowed across the lake.</action> When he reached the other side he<action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral"> began to walk along the shore, and to sprinkle and strew the grain, and at last he coaxed the ducks into his kneading-trough, and rowed back as fast as ever he could</action>.</p>

<p>When he got half over, the <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="negative"><character>Troll</character> came out of his house, and set eyes on him.</action></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“HALLOA!” roared out the Troll; “is it you that has gone off with my seven silver ducks.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“AYE! AYE!” said the lad.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Shall you be back soon?”</dialogue> asked the Troll.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“Very likely”</dialogue>, said the lad.</p>

<p><descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots" sign="positive">So when he got back to the king, with the seven silver ducks, he was more liked than ever,</descriptor> and even the king was pleased to say, <dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“Well done!”</dialogue> But at this <descriptor subject="Elder Brothers" sign="negative" speaker="Narrator">his brothers grew more and more spiteful and envious;</descriptor> and so they <action actor="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots" sign="Negative">went and told the coachman that their brother had said, if he chose, he was man enough to get the king the Troll’s bed-quilt, which had a gold patch and a silver patch, and a silver patch and a gold patch;</action> and this time, too,<action actor="Coachman" subject="Boots" sign="neutral"> the coachman was not slow in telling all this to the king</action>. So <action actor="King" subject="Boots" sign="negative">the king said to the lad, how his brothers had said he was good to steal the Troll’s bed-quilt, with gold and silver patches; so now he must go and do it, or lose his life.</action></p>

<p>Boots <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="negative">answered, he had never thought or said any such thing; but when he found there was no help for it, he begged for three days to think over the matter</action>.</p>

<p>So when the three days were gone, <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral">he rowed over in his kneading-trough, and went spying about.</action> At last <action actor="Boots" subject="Troll" sign="neutral">he saw those in the Troll’s cave come out and hang the quilt out to air, and as soon as ever they had gone back into the face of the rock,</action><action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral"> Boots pulled the quilt down, and rowed away with it as fast as he could.</action></p>

<p>And when he was half across, <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="negative">out came the Troll and set eyes on him, and roared out</action>:</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“HALLOA! Is it you who took my seven silver ducks?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“AYE! AYE!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“And now, have you taken my bed-quilt, with silver patches and gold patches, and gold patches and silver patches?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Aye! aye!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Shall you come back again?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Very likely”</dialogue>, said the lad.</p>

<p><descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots" sign="positive">But when he got back with the gold and silver patchwork quilt, every one was fonder of him than ever, and he was made the king’s body-servant.
</descriptor></p>
<p><descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Elder Brothers" sign="negative">At this, the other two were still more vexed, and, to be revenged,</descriptor> they went and told the coachman:</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Elder Brothers" subject="Boots">“Now, our brother has said, he is man enough to get the king the gold harp which the Troll has, and that harp is of such a kind, that all who listen when it is played grow glad, however sad they may be.”</dialogue></p>

<p>Yes! the coachman went and told the king, and he said to the lad:</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“If you have said this, you shall do it. If you do it, you shall have the Princess and half the kingdom. If you don’t, you shall lose your life.”
</dialogue></p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="self">“I’m sure I never thought or said anything of the kind”, said the lad; “but if there’s no help for it, I may as well try; but I must have six days to think about it.”</dialogue>
</p>
<p>Yes! he might have six days, but when they were over, he must set out.
</p>
<p>Then <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral">he took a tenpenny nail, a birch-pin, and a waxen taper-end in his pocket, and rowed across, and walked up and down before the Troll’s cave, looking stealthily about him</action>. So when the Troll came out, he saw him at once.
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“HO, HO!” roared the Troll; “is it you who took my seven silver ducks?”</dialogue>
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“AYE! AYE!”</dialogue> said the lad.
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“And it is you who took my bed-quilt, with the gold and silver patches?”</dialogue> asked the Troll.
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Aye! aye!”</dialogue> said the lad.
</p>
<p>So the <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="Negative">Troll caught hold of him at once, and took him off into the cave in the face of the rock.</action></p>
    
<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Now, <character who="Troll Daughter">daughter</character> dear”, said the Troll, “I’ve caught the fellow who stole the silver ducks and my bed-quilt, with gold and silver patches; put him into the fattening coop, and when he’s fat, we’ll kill him, and make a feast for our friends.”</dialogue></p>

<p>She was willing enough, and <action actor="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots" sign="negative">put him at once into the fattening coop, and there he stayed eight days, fed on the best, both in meat and drink, and as much as he could cram.</action> So, when the eight days were over, <action actor="Trolls" subject="Boots" sign="negative">the Troll said to his daughter to go down and cut him in his little finger, that they might see if he were fat. Down she came to the coop</action>.
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots">“Out with your little finger!”</dialogue> she said.
</p>
<p>But <action actor="Boots" subject="Troll Daughter" sign="Positive">Boots stuck out his tenpenny nail, and she cut at it</action>.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots">“Nay! nay! he’s as hard as iron still”, said the Troll’s daughter, when she got back to her father; “we can’t take him yet.”</dialogue>
</p>
<p>After another eight days the same thing happened, and this time <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="neutral">Boots stuck out his birchen pin</action>.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots">“Well, he’s a little better”, she said, when she got back to the Troll; “but still he’ll be as hard as wood to chew.”</dialogue>
</p>
<p>But when another eight days were gone, the Troll told his daughter to go down and see if he wasn’t fat now.
</p>
<p>“<dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots">Out with your little finger”</dialogue>, said the Troll’s daughter, when she reached the coop, and this time <action actor="Boots" subject="Troll Daughter" sign="neutral">Boots stuck out the taper end.</action>
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="Boots">“Now he’ll do nicely”</dialogue>, she said.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Will he?” said the Troll. “Well, then, I’ll just set off and ask the guests; meantime you must kill him, and roast half and boil half.”</dialogue>
</p>
<p>So when the Troll had been gone a little while, <action actor="Troll Daughter" subject="knife" sign="neutral">the daughter began to sharpen a great long knife</action>.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="knife">“Is that what you’re going to kill me with?”</dialogue> asked the lad.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll Daughter" subject="knife">“Yes it is,”</dialogue> said she.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="knife">“But it isn’t sharp”, said the lad. “Just let me sharpen it for you, and then you’ll find it easier work to kill me.”</dialogue></p>

<p><action actor="Boots" subject="Troll Daughter" sign="neutral">So she let him have the knife, and he began to rub and sharpen it on the whetstone.</action></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="knife">“Just let me try it on one of your hair plaits; I think it’s about right now.”</dialogue></p>

<p><action actor="Boots" subject="Troll Daughter" sign="Positive">So he got leave to do that; but at the same time that he grasped the plait of hair, he pulled back her head, and at one gash, cut off the Troll’s daughter’s head; and half of her he roasted and half of her he boiled, and served it all up.</action></p>

<p><action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="positive">After that he dressed himself in her clothes, and sat away in the corner.</action></p>

<p>So when the <action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="neutral">Troll came home with his guests, he called out to his daughter—for he thought all the time it was his daughter—to come and take a snack.</action></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“No, thank you”, said the lad, “I don’t care for food, I’m so sad and downcast.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Oh!” said the Troll, “if that’s all, you know the cure; take the harp, and play a tune on it.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Harp">“Yes!” said the lad; “but where has it got to; I can’t find it.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Harp">“Why, you know well enough”, said the Troll; “you used it last; where should it be but over the door yonder?</dialogue>
</p>
<p>The lad did not wait to be told twice; <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="Positive">he took down the harp, and went in and out playing tunes; but, all at once he shoved off the kneading-trough, jumped into it, and rowed off, so that the foam flew around the trough</action>.</p>

<p>After a while the Troll thought his daughter was a long while gone,<action actor="Troll" subject="Boots" sign="negative"> and went out to see what ailed her; and then he saw the lad in the trough, far, far out on the lake</action>.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“HALLOA! Is it you”, he roared, “that took my seven silver ducks?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“AYE, AYE!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“Is it you that took my bed-quilt, with the gold and silver patches.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Yes!”</dialogue> said the lad.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“And now you have taken off my gold harp?”</dialogue> screamed the Troll.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“Yes!” said the lad; “I’ve got it, sure enough.”</dialogue>
</p>
<p><dialogue speaker="Troll" subject="Boots">“And haven’t I eaten you up after all, then?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Troll">“No, no! ’twas your own daughter you ate”</dialogue>, answered the lad.</p>

<p>But <action actor="Troll" subject="self" sign="negative">when the Troll heard that, he was so sorry, he burst</action>; and then <action actor="Boots" subject="self" sign="Positive">Boots rowed back, and took a whole heap of gold and silver with him, as much as the trough could carry. And so, when he came to the palace with the gold harp, he got the Princess and half the kingdom, as the king had promised him; and, as for his brothers, he treated them well, for he thought they had only wished his good when they said what they had said.</action></p></body></story>
