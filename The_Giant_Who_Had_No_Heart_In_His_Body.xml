    <title>THE GIANT WHO HAD NO HEART IN HIS BODY</title>

    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was a <character>king</character>
            <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="King">who had seven sons, and he loved them so
                much that he could never bear to be without them all at once, but one must always be
                with him.</descriptor> Now, when they were grown up, six were to set off to woo, but
            as for the <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="Boots">youngest</descriptor>, his
            father kept him at home, and the others were to bring back a princess for him to the
            palace. So the king gave the six the finest clothes you ever set eyes on, so fine that
            the light gleamed from them a long way off, and each had his horse, which cost many,
            many hundred dollars, and so they set off. Now, when they had been to many palaces, and
            seen many princesses, at last they came to a king who had six daughters; such lovely
            king’s daughters they had never seen, and so they fell to wooing them, each one, and
            when they had got them for sweethearts, they set off home again, but they quite forgot
            that they were to bring back with them a sweetheart for <character>Boots</character>,
            their brother, who stayed at home, for they were over head and ears in love with their
            own sweethearts.</p>

        <p>But when they had gone a good bit on their way, they passed close by a steep hill-side,
            like a wall, where the giant’s house was, and there the <character>giant</character>
            came out, and set his eyes upon them, and <action actor="giant"
                subject="princes and princesses">turned them all into stone, princes and princesses
                and all.</action> Now the king waited and waited for his six sons, but the more he
            waited, the longer they stayed away; so he fell into great trouble, and said he should
            never know what it was to be glad again.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“And if I had not you left”, he said to Boots,
                “I would live no longer, so full of sorrow am I for the loss of your
                brothers.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="King">“Well, but now I’ve been thinking to ask your
                leave to set out and find them again; that’s what I’m thinking of”, said
                Boots.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="King" subject="Boots">“Nay, nay!” said his father; “that leave you
                shall never get, for then you would stay away too.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>But Boots had set his heart upon it; go he would; and he begged and prayed so long that
            the king was forced to let him go. Now, you must know the king had no other horse to
            give Boots but an old broken-down jade, for his six other sons and their train had
            carried off all his horses; but Boots did not care a pin for that, he sprang up on his
            sorry-old-steed.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="King">“Farewell, father”, said he; “I’ll come back,
                never fear, and like enough I shall bring my six brothers back with me”; and with
                that he rode off.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So, when he had ridden a while, he came to a Raven, which lay in the road and flapped its
            wings, and was not able to get out of the way, it was so starved.</p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="raven">“Oh, dear friend”, said the Raven,
                “give me a little food, and I’ll help you again at your utmost need.”</fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Raven">“I haven’t much food”, said the Prince, “and I
                don’t see how you’ll ever be able to help me much; but still I can spare you a
                little. I see you want it.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <action actor="Boots" subject="Raven">So he gave the raven some of the food he had
                brought with him.</action>
        </p>

        <p>Now, when he had gone a bit further, he came to a brook, and in the brook lay a great
            Salmon, which had got upon a dry place and dashed itself about, and could not get into
            the water again.</p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="Salmon">
                <dialogue speaker="Salmon" subject="Boots">“Oh, dear friend”, said the Salmon to the
                    Prince; “shove me out into the water again, and I’ll help you again at your
                    utmost need.”</dialogue>
            </fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Salmon">“Well!” said the Prince, “the help you’ll give
                me will not be great, I daresay, but it’s a pity you should lie there and
                choke”</dialogue>; and with that <action actor="Boots" subject="Salmon">he shot the
                fish out into the stream again.</action></p>

        <p>After that he went a long, long way, and there met him a <character type="Wolf"
                >Wolf</character>, which was so famished that it lay and crawled along the road on
            its belly.</p>

        <p>
            <fig_lang type="personification" subject="Wolf">
                <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Dear friend, do let me have your horse”,
                    said the Wolf; “I’m so hungry the wind whistles through my ribs; I’ve had
                    nothing to eat these two years.”</dialogue>
            </fig_lang>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Wolf">“No”, said Boots, “this will never do; “first I
                came to a raven, and I was forced to give him my food; next I came to a salmon, and
                him I had to help into the water again; and now you will have my horse. It can’t be
                done, that it can’t, for then I should have nothing to ride on.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Nay, dear friend, but you can help me”, said
                Graylegs the wolf; “you can ride upon my back, and I’ll help you again in your
                utmost need.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Well! the help I shall get from you will not
                be great, I’ll be bound”, said the Prince; “but you may take my horse, since you are
                in such need.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <action actor="Wolf" subject="Boots">So when the wolf had eaten the horse, Boots took
                the bit and put it into the wolf’s jaw, and laid the saddle on his back; and now the
                wolf was so strong, after what he had got inside, that he set off with the Prince
                like nothing. So fast he had never ridden before.</action>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“When we have gone a bit farther”, said
                Graylegs; “I’ll show you the Giant’s house.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So after a while they came to it.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“See, here is the Giant’s house”, said the
                Wolf; “and see, here are your six brothers, whom the Giant has turned into stone;
                and see here are their six brides, and away yonder is the door, and in at that door
                you must go.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Wolf">“Nay, but I daren’t go in”, said the Prince;
                “he’ll take my life.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“No! no!” said the Wolf; “when you get in
                you’ll find a Princess, and she’ll tell you what to do to make an end of the Giant.
                Only mind and do as she bids you.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Well! <character type="Boots">Boots</character> went in, but, truth to say, he was very
            much afraid. When he came in the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> was away, but
            in one of the rooms sat the Princess, just as the wolf had said, and so lovely a
                <character type="Princess">princess</character> Boots had never yet set eyes on.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“Oh! heaven help you! whence have you
                come?” said the Princess, as she saw him; “it will surely be your death. No one can
                make an end of the Giant who lives here, for he has no heart in his
                body.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Princess">“Well! well!” said Boots; “but now that I
                am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can’t free my
                brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to
                save, that I will.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“Well, if you must, you must”, said the
                Princess; “and so let us see if we can’t hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed
                yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still
                as a mouse.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the
                <character type="Giant">Giant</character> came.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“Ha!” roared the Giant, “what a smell of
                Christian blood there is in the house!”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Yes, I know there is”, said the Princess,
                “for there came a magpie flying with a man’s bone, and let it fall down the chimney.
                I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn’t go
                off so soon.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> said no more about it, and when night
            came, they went to bed. After they had lain awhile, the Princess said:</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“There is one thing I’d be so glad to ask
                you about, if I only dared.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“What thing is that?” asked the
                Giant.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Only where it is you keep your heart,
                since you don’t carry it about you”, said the Princess.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“Ah! that’s a thing you’ve no business to
                ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill”, said the
                Giant.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots" subject="Boots">“Ho! ho!” said Boots to himself under the bed,
                “then we’ll soon see if we can’t find it.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Next morning the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> got up cruelly early, and
            strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before <action
                actor="Boots and Princess" subject="seeking Giant's heart">Boots and the Princess
                set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and
                the more they hunted, the more they couldn’t find it.</action></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“He has baulked us this time”, said the
                Princess, “but we’ll try him once more.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p><action actor="Princess" subject="stewing flowers">So she picked all the prettiest
                flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in
                its right place again</action>; and when the time came for the <character
                type="Giant">Giant</character> to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just
            as he was well under, back came the <character type="Giant">Giant</character>.</p>

        <p>Snuff—snuff, went the Giant’s nose. <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“My eyes
                and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here”, said
            he.</dialogue></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“I know there is”, said the Princess, “for
                there came a magpie flying with a man’s bone in his bill, and let it fall down the
                chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it’s that you
                smell.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> held his peace, and said no more about
            it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the
            door-sill.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Oh, I, of course”, said the
                Princess.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all
                this?” said the Giant.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Ah!” said the Princess, “I’m so fond of
                you that I couldn’t help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under
                there.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“You don’t say so”, said the Giant; “but
                after all it doesn’t lie there at all.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the <character
                type="Giant">Giant</character> again where his heart was, for she said she would so
            like to know.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“Well”, said the Giant, “if you must know,
                it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Boots and Princess" subject="themselves">“So, so!” thought Boots and
                the Princess; “then we’ll soon try to find it.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Next morning the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> was away early, and strode off
            to the wood, and so soon as he was gone <action actor="Boots and Princess"
                subject="seeking Giant's heart">Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting
                for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it.</action></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Boots">“Well”, said the Princess, “we’ll just try
                him once more.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <action actor="Princess" subject="decorating cupboard">So she decked out the cupboard
                with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots
                crept under the bed again.</action>
        </p>

        <p>Then back came the <character type="Giant">Giant</character>.</p>

        <p>Snuff-snuff! <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“My eyes and limbs, what a
                smell of Christian blood there is in here!”</dialogue></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“I know there is”, said the Princess; “for
                a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man’s bone in his bill, and
                let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the
                house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it’s that you smell.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>When the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> heard that, he said no more about it;
            but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and
            garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the
            Princess.</p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“And, pray, what’s the meaning of all this
                tom-foolery?” asked the Giant.</dialogue></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Oh, I’m so fond of you, I couldn’t help
                doing it when I knew that your heart lay there”, said the Princess.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“How can you be so silly as to believe any
                such thing?” said the Giant.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when
                you say it”, said the Princess.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“You’re a goose”, said the Giant; “where my
                heart is, you will never come.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Princess" subject="Giant">“Well”, said the Princess;” but for all
                that, ’twould be such a pleasure to know where it really lies.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Then the poor <character type="Giant">Giant</character> could hold out no longer, but was
            forced to say:</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Princess">“Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on
                that island stands a church; in that church is a well; in that well swims a duck; in
                that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart,—you
                darling!”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the <character type="Giant"
                >Giant</character> strode off to the wood.</p>

        <p>“Yes! now I must set off too”, said Boots; “if I only knew how to find the way.” He took
            a long, long farewell of the Princess, and when he got out of the Giant’s door, there
            stood the <character type="Wolf">Wolf</character> waiting for him. So <character
                type="Boots">Boots</character> told him all that had happened inside the house, and
            said now he wished to ride to the well in the church, if he only knew the way. <action
                actor="Wolf" textual_content="helping Boot's find the Giant's heart">So the Wolf
                bade him jump on his back, he’d soon find the way; and away they went, till the wind
                whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and dale. After they had
                travelled many, many days, they came at last to the lake. Then the Prince did not
                know how to get over it, but the Wolf bade him only not be afraid, but stick on, and
                so he jumped into the lake with the Prince on his back, and swam over to the island.
                So they came to the church</action>; but the church keys hung high, high up on the
            top of the tower, and at first the Prince did not know how to get them down.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“You must call on the raven”, said the
                Wolf.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p><action actor="Raven" textual_content="helping Boots retrieve the key">So the Prince
                called on the raven, and in a trice the raven came, and flew up and fetched the
                keys, and so the Prince got into the church</action>. But when he came to the well,
            there lay the duck, and swam about backwards and forwards, just as the <character
                type="Giant">Giant</character> had said. So the Prince stood and coaxed it and
            coaxed it, till it came to him, and he grasped it in his hand; but just as he lifted it
            up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well, and then <character
                type="Boots">Boots</character> was beside himself to know how to get it out
            again.</p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Well, now you must call on the salmon to be
                sure”, said the Wolf</dialogue>; and the king’s son called on the salmon, <action
                actor="Salmon" textual_content="helping Boots fetche the egg">and the salmon came
                and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the well.</action></p>

        <p>Then the Wolf told him to <action actor="Boots" subject="Giant">squeeze the egg, and as
                soon as ever he squeezed it the Giant screamed out.</action></p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Squeeze it again”, said the Wolf</dialogue>;
                <action actor="Boots" textual_content="squeezing Giant's heart">and when the Prince
                did so</action>, the <character type="Giant">Giant</character> screamed still more
            piteously, and <dialogue speaker="Giant" subject="Boots">begged and prayed so prettily
                to be spared, saying he would do all that the Prince wished if he would only not
                squeeze his heart in two.</dialogue></p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Tell him, if he will restore to life again your
                six brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone, you will spare his
                life”, said the Wolf.</dialogue> Yes, the <character type="Giant">Giant</character>
            was ready to do that, and <action actor="Giant"
                textual_content="return princes and princesses back to being human">he turned the
                six brothers into king’s sons again, and their brides into king’s
                daughters.</action></p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Wolf" subject="Boots">“Now, squeeze the egg in two”, said the
                Wolf.</dialogue>
            <action actor="Boots" textual_content="Boots kills the Giant"> So Boots squeezed the egg
                to pieces, and the Giant burst at once.</action>
        </p>

        <p>Now, when he had made an end of the <character type="Giant">Giant</character>, <character
                type="Boots">Boots</character> rode back again on the wolf to the Giant’s house, and
            there stood all his six brothers alive and merry, with their brides. Then <character
                type="Boots">Boots</character> went into the hill-side after his bride, and so they
            all set off home again to their father’s house. And you may fancy how glad the old king
            was when he saw all his seven sons come back, each with his bride—<dialogue
                speaker="King" subject="everyone">“But the loveliest bride of all is the bride of
                Boots, after all”, said the king, “and he shall sit uppermost at the table, with her
                by his side.”</dialogue></p>

        <p>So he sent out, and called a great wedding-feast, and the mirth was both loud and long,
            and if they have not done feasting, why, they are still at it.</p>
