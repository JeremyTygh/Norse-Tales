    <title>TATTERHOOD</title>
    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was a <character>king and a queen</character>
            <descriptor speaker="Narrator" subject="King and Queen" sign="neutral">who had no
                children</descriptor>, and that gave the queen much grief; she scarce had one happy
            hour. She was always bewailing and bemoaning herself, and saying how dull and lonesome
            it was in the palace.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Queen" subject="herself">“If we had children there’d be life enough”,
                she said.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Wherever she went in all her realm she found God’s blessing in children, even in the
            vilest hut; and wherever she came she heard the Goodies scolding the bairns, and saying
            how they had done that and that wrong. All this the queen heard, and thought it would be
            so nice to do as other women did. At last the king and queen took into their palace a
            stranger <character>lassie</character> to rear up, that they might have her always with
            them, to love her if she did well, and scold her if she did wrong, like their own
            child.</p>

        <p>So one day the little <character>lassie</character> whom they had taken as their own, ran
            down into the palace yard, and was playing with a gold apple. Just then an
                <character>old beggar wife</character> came by, who had a <character>little
                girl</character> with her, and it wasn’t long before the little lassie and the
            beggar’s bairn were great friends, and began to play together, and to toss the gold
            apple about between them. When the Queen saw this, as she sat at a window in the palace,
            she tapped on the pane for her foster-daughter to come up. She went at once, but the
            beggar-girl went up too; and as they went into the Queen’s bower, each held the other by
            the hand. Then the Queen began to scold the little lady, and to say:</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Queen" subject="lassie">“You ought to be above running about and
                playing with a tattered beggar’s brat.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>And so she wanted to drive the lassie downstairs.</p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="little girl" subject="Queen">“If the Queen only knew my mother’s
                power, she’d not drive me out”, said the little lassie</dialogue>; and when the
            Queen asked what she meant more plainly, she told her how her mother could get her
            children if she chose. The Queen wouldn’t believe it, but the lassie held her own, and
            said every word of it was true, and bade the Queen only to try and make her mother do
            it. So the Queen sent the lassie down to fetch up her mother.</p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Queen" subject="old beggar wife">“Do you know what your daughter
                says?” asked the Queen</dialogue> of the old woman, as soon as ever she came into
            the room.</p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="old beggar wife" subject="Queen">No</dialogue>; the beggar wife knew
            nothing about it.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Queen" subject="old beggar wife">“Well, she says you can get me
                children if you will”, answered the Queen.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="old beggar wife" subject="Queen">“Queens shouldn’t listen to beggar
                lassies’ silly stories”, said the old wife</dialogue>, and strode out of the
            room.</p>

        <p>Then the Queen got angry, and wanted again to drive out the little lassie; but she
            declared it was true every word that she had said.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="little girl" subject="Queen">“Let the Queen only give my mother a
                drop to drink,” said the lassie; “when she gets merry she’ll soon find out a way to
                help you.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>The Queen was ready to try this; so the beggar wife was fetched up again once more, and
            treated both with wine and mead as much as she chose; and so it was not long before her
            tongue began to wag. Then the Queen came out again with the same question she had asked
            before.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="old beggar wife" subject="Queen">“One way to help you perhaps I
                know”, said the beggar wife. “Your Majesty must make them bring in two pails of
                water some evening before you go to bed. In each of them you must wash yourself, and
                afterwards throw away the water under the bed. When you look under the bed next
                morning, two flowers will have sprung up, one fair and one ugly. The fair one you
                must eat, the ugly one you must let stand; but mind you don’t forget the
                last.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>That was what the beggar wife said.</p>

        <p>Yes; the Queen did what the beggar wife advised her to do; she had the water brought up
            in two pails, washed herself in them, and emptied them under the bed; and lo! when she
            looked under the bed next morning, there stood two flowers; one was ugly and foul, and
            had black leaves; but the other was so bright, and fair, and lovely, she had never seen
            its like; so she ate it up at once. But the pretty flower tasted so sweet, that she
            couldn’t help herself. She ate the other up too, for, she thought, <dialogue
                speaker="Queen" subject="herself">“it can’t hurt or help one much either way, I’ll
                be bound”.</dialogue></p>

        <p>Well, sure enough, after a while the Queen was brought to bed. First of all, she had a
                <descriptor speaker="narrator" subject="Tatterhood" sign="negative">girl who had a
                wooden spoon in her hand, and rode upon a goat; loathly and ugly she was, and the
                very moment she came into the world</descriptor>, she bawled out <dialogue
                speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Queen">“Mamma”</dialogue>.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Queen" subject="Tatterhood">“If I’m your mamma”, said the Queen, “God
                give me grace to mend my ways.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Queen">“Oh, don’t be sorry”, said the girl, who
                rode on the goat, “for one will soon come after me who is better
                looking.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>So, after a while, the Queen had <character>another girl</character>, <descriptor
                speaker="narrator" subject="younger twin" sign="neutral">who was so fair and sweet,
                no one had ever set eyes on such a lovely child</descriptor>, and with her you may
            fancy the Queen was very well pleased. The <descriptor speaker="narrator"
                subject="Tatterhood/elder twin" sign="neutral">elder twin they called “Tatterhood”,
                because she was always so ugly and ragged, and because she had a hood which hung
                about her ears in tatters</descriptor>. The Queen could scarce bear to look at her,
            and the nurses tried to shut her up in a room by herself, but it was all no good; where
            the younger twin was, there she must also be, and no one could ever keep them apart.</p>

        <p>Well, one Christmas eve, when they were half grown up, there rose such a frightful noise
            and clatter in the gallery outside the Queen’s bower. So Tatterhood asked what it was
            that dashed and crashed so out in the passage.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Queen" subject="Tatterhood">“Oh!” said the Queen, “it isn’t worth
                asking about.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>But Tatterhood wouldn’t give over till she found out all about it and so the Queen told
            her it was a pack of Trolls and witches who had come there to keep Christmas. So
            Tatterhood said she’d just go out and drive them away; and in spite of all they could
            say, and however much they begged and prayed her to let the Trolls alone, she must and
            would go out to drive the witches off; but <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood"
                subject="Queen">she begged the Queen to mind and keep all the doors close shut, so
                that not one of them came so much as the least bit ajar.</dialogue> Having said
            this, <action actor="Tatterhood" subject="trolls and witches" sign="positive">off she
                went with her wooden spoon, and began to hunt and sweep away the hags</action>; and
            all this while there was such a pother out in the gallery, the like of it was never
            heard. The whole Palace creaked and groaned as if every joint and beam were going to be
            torn out of its place. Now, how it was, I’m sure I can’t tell; but somehow or other one
            door did get the least bit ajar, <action actor="witch" subject="younger twin"
                sign="negative">then her twin sister just peeped out to see how things were going
                with Tatterhood, and put her head a tiny bit through the opening. But, POP! up came
                an old witch, and whipped off her head, and stuck a calf’s head on her shoulders
                instead; and so the Princess ran back into the room on all-fours, and began to “moo”
                like a calf.</action> When Tatterhood came back and saw her sister, she scolded them
            all round, and was very angry because they hadn’t kept better watch, and asked them what
            they thought of their heedlessness now, when her sister was turned into a calf.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="everyone">“But still I’ll see if I can’t set her
                free”, she said.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>Then she asked the King for a ship in full trim, and well fitted with stores; but captain
            and sailors she wouldn’t have. No; she would sail away with her sister all alone; and as
            there was no holding her back, at last they let her have her own way.</p>

        <p>Then Tatterhood sailed off, and steered her ship right under the land where the witches
            dwelt, and when she came to the landing-place, she told her sister to stay quite still
            on board the ship; <action actor="Tatterhood" subject="witches" sign="positive">but she
                herself rode on her goat up to the witches’ castle. When she got there, one of the
                windows in the gallery was open, and there she saw her sister’s head hung up on the
                window frame; so she leapt her goat through the window into the gallery, snapped up
                the head, and set off with it. After her came the witches to try to get the head
                again, and they flocked about her as thick as a swarm of bees or a nest of ants; but
                the goat snorted, and puffed, and butted with his horns, and Tatterhood beat and
                banged them about with her wooden spoon; and so the pack of witches had to give it
                up.</action>
            <action actor="Tatterhood" subject="younger twin" sign="positive">So Tatterhood got back
                to her ship, took the calf’s head off her sister, and put her own on again, and then
                she became a girl as she had been before.</action> After that she sailed a long,
            long way, to a strange king’s realm.</p>

        <p>Now the <character>king</character> of that land was a widower, and had an only son. So
            when he saw the strange sail, he sent messengers down to the strand to find out whence
            it came, and who owned it; but when the king’s men came down there, they saw never a
            living soul on board but Tatterhood, and there she was, riding round and round the deck
            on her goat at full speed, till her elf locks streamed again in the wind. The folk from
            the palace were all amazed at this sight, and asked, were there not more on board? Yes,
            there were; she had a sister with her, said Tatterhood. Her, too, they wanted to see,
            but Tatterhood said “No”:</p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="foreign king's men">“No one shall see her, unless
                the king comes himself”, she said;</dialogue> and so she began to gallop about on
            her goat till the deck thundered again.</p>

        <p>So when the servants got back to the palace, and told what they had seen and heard down
            at the ship, the king was for setting out at once, that he might see the lassie that
            rode on the goat. When he got down, Tatterhood led out her sister, and she was so fair
            and gentle, the king fell over head and ears in love with her as he stood. He brought
            them both back with him to the Palace, and wanted to have the sister for his queen; but
            Tatterhood said <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="King">“No”; the king couldn’t
                have her in any way, unless the king’s son chose to have Tatterhood.</dialogue> That
            you may fancy the <character>prince</character> was very loath to do, such an ugly hussy
            as Tatterhood was; but at last the king and all the others in the palace talked him
            over, and he yielded, giving his word to take her for his queen; but it went sore
            against the grain, and he was a doleful man.</p>

        <p>Now they set about the wedding, both with brewing and baking; and when all was ready,
            they were to go to church; but the <character>prince</character> thought it the weariest
            churching he had ever had in all his life. First, the king drove off with his bride, and
            she was so lovely and so grand, all the people stopped to look after her all along the
            road, and they stared at her till she was out of sight. After them came the prince on
            horseback by the side of Tatterhood, who trotted along on her goat with her wooden spoon
            in her fist, and to look at him, it was more like going to a burial than a wedding, and
            that his own; so sorrowful he seemed, and with never a word to say.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“Why don’t you talk?” asked Tatterhood,
                when they had ridden a bit.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="Tatterhood">“Why, what should I talk about?”
                answered the prince.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“Well, you might at least ask me why I
                ride upon this ugly goat”, said Tatterhood.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="Tatterhood">“Why do you ride on that ugly goat?”
                asked the prince.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“Is it an ugly goat? why, it’s the
                grandest horse bride ever rode on”, answered Tatterhood;</dialogue>
            <misconception actor="Prince" subject="Tatterhood's goat" sign="positive">and in a trice
                the goat became a horse, and that the finest the prince had ever set eyes
                on.</misconception>
        </p>

        <p>Then they rode on again a bit, but the prince was just as woeful as before, and couldn’t
            get a word out. So Tatterhood asked him again why he didn’t talk, and when the Prince
            answered he didn’t know what to talk about, she said:</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“You can at least ask me why I ride with
                this ugly spoon in my fist.”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="Tatterhood">“Why do you ride with that ugly spoon?
                “asked the prince.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“Is it an ugly spoon? why, it’s the
                loveliest silver wand bride ever bore”, said Tatterhood;</dialogue>
            <misconception actor="Prince" subject="Tatterhood" sign="positive"> and in a trice it
                became a silver wand, so dazzling bright, the sunbeams glistened from
                it.</misconception>
        </p>

        <p>So they rode on another bit, but the Prince was just as sorrowful, and said never a word.
            In a little while, Tatterhood asked him again why he didn’t talk, and bade him ask why
            she wore that ugly grey hood on her head.</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="Tatterhood">“Why do you wear that ugly grey hood on
                your head?” asked the Prince.</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“Is it an ugly hood? why, it’s the
                brightest golden crown bride ever wore”, answered Tatterhood,</dialogue>
            <misconception actor="Prince" subject="Tatterhood" sign="positive"> and it became a
                crown on the spot.</misconception>
        </p>

        <p>Now, they rode on a long while again, and the Prince was so woeful, that he sat without
            sound or speech just as before. So his bride asked him again why he didn’t talk, and
            bade him ask now, why her face was so ugly and ashen-grey?</p>

        <p>
            <dialogue speaker="Prince" subject="Tatterhood">“Ah!” asked the Prince, “why is your
                face so ugly and ashen-grey?”</dialogue>
        </p>

        <p><dialogue speaker="Tatterhood" subject="Prince">“I ugly”, said the bride; “you think my
                sister pretty, but I am ten times prettier”;</dialogue> and lo!<misconception
                actor="Prince" subject="Tatterhood" sign="positive"> when the Prince looked at her,
                she was so lovely, he thought there never was so lovely a woman in all the
                world.</misconception> After that, I shouldn’t wonder if the Prince found his
            tongue, and no longer rode along hanging down his head.</p>

        <p>So they drank the bridal cup both deep and long, and, after that, both Prince and King
            set out with their brides to the Princess’s father’s palace, and there they had another
            bridal feast, and drank anew, both deep and long. There was no end to the fun; and, if
            you make haste and run to the King’s palace, I dare say you’ll find there’s still a drop
            of the bridal ale left for you.</p>
