    <title>THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND</title>
    <body>
        <p>Once on a time there was an <character>old widow</character> who had one
                <character>son</character>; and as she was <descriptor speaker="narrator"
                subject="mother" sign="negative">poorly</descriptor> and <descriptor
                speaker="narrator" subject="mother" sign="negative">weak</descriptor>, her son had
            to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and
            was just going down the steps, there came the <character>North Wind</character>, <action
                actor="North Wind" subject="meal" sign="negative">puffing</action> and <action
                actor="North Wind" subject="meal" sign="negative">blowing</action>, caught up the
            meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the lad went back into the safe for
            more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the <character>North Wind</character>
            didn’t come again and carry off the meal with a <action actor="North Wind"
                subject="meal" sign="negative">puff</action>; and, more than that, he did so the
            third time. At this the lad got very <descriptor speaker="narrator" subject="lad"
                sign="negative">angry</descriptor>; and as he thought it hard that the
                <character>North Wind</character> should behave so, he thought he’d just look him
            up, and ask him to give up his meal.</p>
        <p>So off he went, but the way was long, and he <action actor="son" subject="environment"
                sign="positive">walked</action> and walked; but at last he came to the
                <character>North Wind</character>’s house.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"Good day!"</dialogue> said the lad, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">and thank you for coming to see us
                yesterday.</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="son">"GOOD DAY!"</dialogue> answered the
                <character>North Wind</character>, for his voice was <descriptor speaker="narrator"
                subject="North Wind" sign = "negative">loud</descriptor> and <descriptor speaker="narrator"
                subject="North Wind" sign = "negative">gruff</descriptor>, <dialogue speaker="North Wind"
                subject="lad">"AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"Oh!"</dialogue> answered the lad, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let
                me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven’t much to
                live on; and if you’re to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there’ll be nothing
                for it but to starve."</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"I haven’t got your meal"</dialogue>, said the
                <character>North Wind</character>; <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"but
                if you are in such need, I’ll give you a cloth which will get you everything you
                want, if you only say, “Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kind of good
                dishes!” "</dialogue></p>
        <p>With this the <character>lad</character> was well <descriptor speaker="narrator"
                subject="lad" sign = "positive">content</descriptor>. But, as the way was so long he couldn’t get home
            in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down to
            supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="cloth">"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good
                dishes."</dialogue></p>
        <p>He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought it
            a fine thing, but most of all the <character>landlady</character>. So, when all were
            fast asleep at dead of night, she took the lad’s cloth, and put another in its stead,
            just like the one he had got from the <character>North Wind</character>, but which
            couldn’t so much as serve up a bit of dry bread.</p>
        <p>So, when the <character>lad</character> woke, he <action actor="lad" subject="cloth" sign = "positive"
                >took</action> his cloth and went off with it, and that day he got home to his
            mother.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="mother">"Now"</dialogue>, said he, <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="mother">"I’ve been to the <character>North Wind</character>’s
                house, and a <descriptor speaker="lad" subject="North Wind" sign = "positive">good</descriptor> fellow
                he is, for he gave me this cloth, and when I only say to it, ‘Cloth, spread
                yourself, and serve up all kind of good dishes’, I get any sort of food I
                please."</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"All very true, I daresay,"</dialogue> said
            his mother; <dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"but seeing is believing, and I
                shan’t believe it till I see it."</dialogue></p>
        <p>So the lad made haste, drew out a table, laid the cloth on it, and said: <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="cloth">"Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kind of good
                dishes."</dialogue></p>
        <p>But never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="old widow">"Well"</dialogue>, said the
                <character>lad</character>, <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="old widow">"there’s no
                help for it but to go to the <character>North Wind</character> again"</dialogue>; and
            away he went. So he came to where the <character>North Wind</character> lived late in
            the afternoon.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"Good evening!"</dialogue> said the
                <character>lad</character>. <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"Good
                evening!"</dialogue> said the <character>North Wind</character>. <dialogue
                speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"I want my rights for that meal of ours which you
                took"</dialogue>, said the lad; <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="North Wind">"for, as
                for that cloth I got, it isn’t worth a penny."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"I’ve got no meal"</dialogue>, said the
                <character>North Wind</character>; <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"but
                yonder you have a ram which coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to
                it: ‘Rain, ram! make money!’"</dialogue></p>
        <p>So the <character>lad</character> thought this a fine thing; but as it was too far to get
            home that day, he turned in for the night to the same inn where he had slept before.</p>
        <p>Before he called for anything, he tried the truth of what the <character>North
                Wind</character> had said of the ram, and found it all right; but, when the
                <character>landlord</character> saw that, he thought it was a famous ram, and, when
            the <character>lad</character> had fallen asleep, he took another which couldn’t coin
            gold ducats, and changed the two.</p>
        <p>Next morning off went the <character>lad</character>; and when he got home to his
                <character>mother</character>, he said: <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="old widow"
                >"After all, the <character>North Wind</character> is a jolly fellow; for now he has
                given me a ram which can coin golden ducats if I only say ‘Ram, ram! make
                money.’"</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"All very true, I daresay"</dialogue>, said
            his <character>mother</character>; <dialogue speaker="old widow" subject="lad">"but I
                shan’t believe any such stuff until I see the ducats made."</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="lad" subject="ram">"Ram, ram! make money!"</dialogue> said the
                <character>lad</character>; but if the Ram made anything, it wasn’t money. So the
                <character>lad</character> went back again to the <character>North Wind</character>,
            and <action actor="lad" subject="North Wind" sign = "negative">blew him up</action>, and said the ram was
            worth nothing, and he must have his rights for the meal.</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"Well!"</dialogue> said the <character>North
                Wind</character>; <dialogue speaker="North Wind" subject="lad">"I’ve nothing else to
                give you but that old stick in the corner yonder; but it’s a stick of that kind that
                if you say: “‘Stick, stick! lay on!’ it lays on till you say: ‘Stick, stick! now
                stop!’"</dialogue></p>
        <p>So, as the way was long, the <character>lad</character> turned in this night too to the
                <character>landlord</character>; but as he could pretty well guess how things stood
            as to the cloth and the ram, he lay down at once on the bench and began to <action
                actor="lad" subject="environment" sign = "negative">snore</action>, as if he were asleep.</p>
        <p>Now the <character>landlord</character>, who easily saw that the stick must be worth
            something, <descriptor speaker="narrator" subject="landlord" sign = "negative">hunted</descriptor> up one
            which was like it, and when he heard the lad snore, was going to change the two; but,
            just as the <character>landlord</character> was about to <action actor="landlord"
                subject="stick" sign = "negative">take</action> it, the lad bawled out: <dialogue speaker="lad"
                subject="stick">"Stick, stick! lay on!"</dialogue></p>
        <p>So the stick began to <action actor="stick" subject="landlord" sign = "negative">beat</action> the
                <character>landlord</character>, till he <action actor="landlord" subject="chair" sign = "negative"
                >jumped</action> over chairs, and tables, and benches, and <action actor="landlord"
                subject="environment" sign = "negative">yelled</action> and <action actor="landlord" subject="encironment" sign = "negative"
                >roared</action>: <dialogue speaker="landlord" subject="lad">"Oh my! oh my! bid the
                stick be still, else it will beat me to death, and you shall have back both your
                cloth and our ram."</dialogue></p>
        <p>When the <character>lad</character> thought the <character>landlord</character> had got
            enough, he said: <dialogue speaker="lad" subject="stick">"Stick, stick! now
                stop!"</dialogue></p>
        <p>Then he <action actor="lad" subject="cloth" sign = "positive">took</action> the cloth and put it into his
            pocket, and went home with his stick in his hand, <action actor="lad" subject="ram" sign = "negative"
                >leading</action> the ram by a cord round its horns; and so he got his rights for
            the meal he had lost.</p>
